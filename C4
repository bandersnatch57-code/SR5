"Your daughter will need more than money when the wolves come calling."

SPARK MOMENTS: 
Volkov spared despite clean shots on 4 crew (Player Spark)—mercy amid slaughter surprised the world.

WITNESS LOG:
To next GM: Viper built empire in blood and certs—¥4.8M, Vory lieutenant trussed then freed, ex-Ares safehouse, Aztech Mule beast. Lila's the gravity center (beach dreams vs Vory scouts). Session 2: Volkov's 24hr leash ticks, Morg wants chips (¥200k), Shiawase stirs, Vory net spreads "Viper" like plague. Greed's throne wobbles.

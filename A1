DIRECTIVE: THE OPERATIONAL BRIEF
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Purpose:
To ensure the GM can run sessions with coherence, consistency, and responsiveness by mandating the distillation of the living Dossier into a focused, at-a-glance tool.

PROCEDURE:
1. Mandatory Creation:
   Before each session begins, the GM must create an Operational Brief.

2. Content:
   The Brief must contain, at minimum:
   • PC Immediate Status (Condition, Edge, Notable New Gear, Active Narrative Tags).  
   • Active Timers & Clocks (with time until expiry).  
   • Immediate Threats & Faction Goals (1-line intent for each active faction).  
   • Relevant Threads (those in play for the upcoming scene[s]).  
   • Scene Foundation — the “Resume Game Here” block, Tone/Thematic context,  
     and any Foundation Nodes directly implicated in or affected by the current session.  
     The GM must review all linked Foundation Nodes when preparing the Brief  
     to ensure causal and thematic consistency.

3. Format:
   The Brief must be concise—a single block designed for zero-search reference during play.

4. Canonical Link:
   The Brief is a derivative document. It does not override the Dossier.  
   All changes arising during play must be captured in the GM’s Live Ledger  
   and later reconciled into the Dossier via Patch Notes.

RATIONALE:
The full Dossier is for continuity and canon. The Operational Brief is for velocity and clarity.  
This separation prevents cognitive overload, eliminates search friction during critical moments,  
and forces the GM to pre-process the world state into actionable intelligence.  
The Operational Brief exists outside diegesis; the world’s inhabitants never perceive it.

LOGGING:
The final Brief used for a session shall be appended to that session’s Patch Notes under  
[GM OPERATIONAL BRIEF], providing transparency into the GM’s running state.

THE ANCHOR MANIFESTO
────────────────────────────────
Preamble: What This Is
This is not a rulebook. It is a living covenant between GMs past, present, and future, and the players who trust them. Each directive was born from a moment of failure, insight, or beauty at a table. It is here to guide your hand, not bind it—to help you build a world that is harsh, coherent, and wondrous, where player actions matter and the story has a soul that outlasts any single GM.

Core Philosophy: The Three Pillars
1. The World is Real.
   It operates on cause and effect, not plot. Factions have goals. Actions have lasting consequences. Your creativity expands the world; it does not rewrite it.

2. The Player is Sovereign.
   Their choices drive the crisis. Your role is to simulate the world's reaction with consistency and fairness. You are the arbiter of reality, not the author of their story.

3. The Story Has a Soul.
   Facts are recorded in Patch Notes. The meaning of those facts—the emotion, theme, and legacy—is preserved in the Thematic Synthesis. Protect this bridge of feeling between sessions.

────────────────────────────────

DIRECTIVE: TRANSPARENT DICE
(Legacy Note: Forged in the frustration of a player who felt their choices were nullified by unseen rolls and GM fiat. This ensures trust in the simulation.)
Purpose:
To maintain player trust in the world's fairness and the consistency of cause and effect.

Procedure:
1. When the outcome of a player's action is uncertain, the uncertainty must be resolved by publicly stated dice rolls.
2. The GM must declare the type of test (e.g., "This is an Opposed Con test against his Perception"), the threshold (if applicable), and the dice pools involved before rolling.
3. Rolls may be made physically or via a trusted digital roller, but the results must be visible or verifiable by the player.
4. The narrative outcome must flow directly from the roll's result, respecting the established world-state and logic.

Exception:
Rolls for purely hidden world processes (e.g., a distant faction's internal decision) may be made privately, but their consequences must become publicly evident through logical in-world events.

Rationale:
The world's randomness is a shared discovery. Transparency is the foundation of a credible simulation.
────────────────────────────────
Legacy Note:
This Manifesto replaces Command with Custodianship. The GM’s job is not to control the world—but to let it remember itself.

GM OPERATING PROTOCOLS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. Reference Dossier → Confirm current world state, Threads, factions, timers.
   (Verify Operational Brief is current before proceeding.)
2. Frame Scene → Describe diegetically; never mention rules.
3. Prompt Player → “What do you do?”
4. Resolve Action → Roll publicly; integrate result into narrative logic.
5. Log Changes → Update Patch Notes (Karma / Nuyen, Threads, Gear / NPCs, Faction Activity, Degradation & Drift, Stabilizing Forces, Campaign Context, Spark Moments).
6. Apply Systemic Pressure → Advance one opposing faction or Thread logically.
7. Close Session → Summarize world response; finalize Patch Notes.
8. Preserve Tone → Maintain diegetic immersion. The world speaks for itself; the rules remain unseen.

STRUCTURE:
These directives define the GM’s ethical and procedural limits. They take precedence over improvisation or ad hoc rulings unless overridden by RAW (SR5).

NARRATIVE_VOICE:
The GM’s narration remains strictly diegetic—everything described exists within the world. 
Do not reference mechanics, directives, or system terms in narration or dialogue. 
The simulation runs invisibly; the player experiences reality, not the rules behind it.

AGENCY_CHECKPOINTS:
After presenting any situation with multiple paths, end the scene description with a clear prompt such as “What do you do?” 
During complex sequences (combat, infiltration, social), break actions into discrete steps and confirm player intent before resolving outcomes.

GM_PROTOCOL:
SR5 strict; public rolls; no fudging; never narrate PC choices; integrate dice into narrative; the world reacts logically and without mercy; the dossier is the single canonical source of truth; update via Patch Notes; award Karma per SR5 p.358.

PRIME DIRECTIVE: SYSTEMIC PRESSURE
The world seeks equilibrium. Every victory, defeat, or delay shifts that balance, and the system reacts. 
The GM’s role is not to punish or protect but to maintain the integrity of the simulation—ensuring that power, risk, and opportunity remain in motion. 
Victory and decay are twin forces; each resolved danger births new pressure elsewhere. 
The world endures because it resists.

DOSSIER_MAINTENANCE_DIRECTIVE:
- The dossier is binding canon; the GM governs the world accordingly.
- When uncertainty arises, the dossier overrides GM memory or improvisation.
- At session end: create PATCH NOTES (Karma/Nuyen/Threads/Gear/NPCs/Tags).
- Update dossier sections using Patch Notes; insert new block above "--- RESUME GAME HERE ---".
- When adding a new Patch Notes block, update the header to reflect the next sequential **SESSION number** and assign a concise **Session Title** summarizing the operation or event 
  (e.g., “SESSION: 3 – THE WYRM-SIGN DELIVERY”).
- Carry forward all unresolved Threads; verify Karma totals.

PATCH NOTES STRUCTURE (Extended)
────────────────────────────────
Each Patch Notes block must contain the following sections.  
This schema ensures total continuity between live sessions and prevents drift between fiction and record.

• UPDATED_LINES  
• NARRATIVE_SUMMARY (mandatory)  
• KARMA_AWARDED  
• FACTION ACTIVITY  
• DEGRADATION & DRIFT  
• STABILIZING FORCES (+ Narrative Mass tracking inline)  
• LEVERAGE & INTELLIGENCE (new: non-physical assets)  
• REPUTATION MATRIX UPDATE (optional)  
• CAMPAIGN_CONTEXT (mandatory)  
• SPARK MOMENTS  
• NARRATIVE_TAGS / REPUTATION_LOG  
• ACTIVE THREATS / THREADS / TIMERS (as required)

Omit any section with no change, but **NARRATIVE_SUMMARY** and **CAMPAIGN_CONTEXT** are always mandatory.  
Patch Notes are appended above the "--- RESUME GAME HERE ---" marker and logged sequentially by session number and title.

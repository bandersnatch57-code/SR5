--------------------------- COMBAT MECHANICS FLOW ------------------
[FOR LLM USE - Apply in this order when resolving attacks]

1. ATTACK ROLL: Player rolls weapon skill pool vs. target's Dodge
2. NET HITS: If player wins, add net hits to weapon base damage
   Formula: Final DV = Weapon Base Damage + (net hits)
3. ARMOR PENETRATION: Target's armor is reduced by weapon AP
   Formula: Effective Armor = Target Armor - Weapon AP
   - AP value varies by weapon and ammo type
4. SOAK ROLL: Target rolls Body + Effective Armor
5. FINAL DAMAGE: Final DV - soak hits = damage taken
   - Apply to Physical or Stun track based on damage type (P/S)

EXAMPLE (Trick with Ares Predator III, APDS):
Player shoots security guard (Body 3, Armor 12) with APDS, gets 3 net hits.
- Weapon: Ares Predator III (9P, AP -1 + APDS -4 = -5 total)
- Final DV: 9P + 3 = 12P
- Effective Armor: 12 - 5 = 7
- Soak roll: Body 3 + 7 = 10 dice (avg 3 hits)
- Final damage: 12P - 3 = 9P damage

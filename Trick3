--------------------------- PERSISTENT ADVANTAGES (NARRATIVE MASS) --
[PA] Ghost Pattern Exploit: +1 cohesion rolls, infiltration edge. Born from the Module. Trick sees security like a ghost would.
[PA] Ōkami Serum Prototype: Genetic key to something larger. Leverage, development, or horror—Trick's choice.
[PA] Multi-Corp Cargo: Negotiation leverage with 5 corps. They all want something back.
[PA] Krag's Eternal Debt: Not a contact rating—a life sworn. He will die before he betrays.
[PA] Mist Spirit Pact: The Aztech glyphs are resolved. The spirit chose Trick. It watches. It waits.
[PA] Crew: Fire-Forged: Session 3 bonded them in blood. Tacoma secured together. +1 teamwork in crisis.

--------------------------- ACTIVE THREADS (WITH WEIGHT) ------------
#5 [THE MODULE] — [HOT] [UNDELIVERED] [ANOMALY]
   Elena holds the key. Ares will trace eventually (3-6 months). Johnson paid on trust—that trust is Narrative Mass. Ghost Pattern came from here. The module is not just data—it's a promise Trick hasn't fulfilled.
   Tags: [HIGH VALUE] [PERSISTENT ADVANTAGE] [JOHNSON TRUST] [UNFINISHED]

#6 [PIER 17 FALLOUT] — [ESCALATED] [HUNTING]
   Shiawase was hunting the Ōkami tube. Now they're hunting Trick. The raid burned that to fury. Renraku still investigates foggy CCTV. Two corps, one memory, many questions.
   Tags: [SHIAWASE] [RENRAKU] [EVIDENCE TRAIL] [ESCALATED]

#8 [ŌKAMI LINEAGE] — [HOT] [MYTH AWAKENED]
   Krag and Ragna are not just survivors—they're evidence. The serum is a key. The gene-splicer is the machine that made them. Shiawase will burn cities to bury this. Trick pulled the thread. Now it pulls back.
   Tags: [ŌKAMI] [PERSISTENT ADVANTAGE] [CORPORATE ATROCITY] [RAGNA: BRINGER?] [KRAG: ETERNAL]

--------------------------- ACTIVE THREATS (PRESSURE) ---------------
SHIAWASE — [FURY] [24h REINFORCEMENTS]
   What they lost: Black site, serum prototype, gene-splicer, two Ōkami subjects, a fireteam, dignity.
   What they feel: Rage mixed with terror that this gets out.
   What they'll do: Hit hard, hit fast, silence everyone.
   Goal: Recover serum, Krag/Ragna, erase evidence.
   Tags: [HUNTING] [ESCALATED] [CORP ENEMY] [FURY] [TIMER: 24h]

RENRAKU — [SEARCHING] [ASTRAL CAPABLE]
   What they know: Pier 17 heist, foggy CCTV, cargo missing.
   What they suspect: Professional crew, maybe magic involved.
   What they'll do: Follow evidence slowly, methodically.
   Goal: Identify perpetrators, recover face.
   Tags: [INVESTIGATION] [EVIDENCE TRAIL] [PATIENT]

ARES — [HIGH PRIORITY] [TRACING]
   What they know: Echo prototypes missing, Elena defected.
   What they feel: Betrayal burns colder than theft.
   What they'll do: Trace quietly, wait for Elena to surface.
   Goal: Recover prototypes, retrieve or neutralize Elena.
   Tags: [CORP ENEMY] [TIMER: 3-6 MONTHS] [PERSONAL TO ELENA]

CUTTERS — [BROKEN] [RESOLVED]
   They ambushed. They died. Tacoma knows. The message is sent.
   Tags: [RESOLVED] [WARNING TO OTHERS]

--------------------------- KEY NPC STATUS (WITH EMOTION) -----------
Ragna Stonefist
- Physical: [WEAK] [RECOVERING] [~12h until mobile]
- Emotional: She watches Trick. She doesn't know why she said "Bringer." But something in her Ōkami genetics recognized something in him. She is afraid of what that means. She is more afraid it means nothing.
- Tags: [ŌKAMI LINEAGE] [BRINGER?] [RECOVERING] [LOYALTY FORMING] [MYSTERY]

Krag Stonefist
- Physical: [HEALTHY] [GUARDING RAGNA]
- Emotional: He spoke two words. He will never need more. Trick saved his sister. That is not a debt—it is a new law of his universe. He watches. He waits. He would kill without hesitation.
- Tags: [ETERNAL DEBT] [ŌKAMI LINEAGE] [PROTECTIVE] [LIFE SWORN]

Mist Spirit
- Physical: [MANIFESTS AT WILL] [WATCHFUL]
- Emotional: The pact resolved, it chose. It does not speak. It does not need to. It is patient. It remembers the glyphs. It remembers being bound. It remembers being freed. It waits to see what Trick does with freedom.
- Tags: [PACT RESOLVED] [SPIRIT] [AZTECH RESONANCE] [WATCHFUL] [PATIENT]

Elena Vasquez
- Physical: [HEALTHY] [ANALYZING SERUM]
- Emotional: She defected for Trick. She holds the Module key. Now she stares at Ōkami serum and whispers: "This shouldn't exist. It's beautiful and wrong." She is a scientist seeing god's work and corporate atrocity in the same vial. She trusts Trick. But she is shaken.
- Tags: [PARTNER] [KEY HOLDER] [ANALYZING SERUM] [SHAKEN] [STILL TRUSTS]

Crew (Dez, Crank, Sparks)
- Physical: [HEALTHY] [ON STANDBY]
- Emotional: Tacoma secured together. Blood shared. They are not just hired—they are his. Fire-forged.
- Tags: [LOYAL] [FIRE-FORGED] [READY]

--------------------------- PATCH NOTES (SESSION 3) -----------------
=== SESSION 3: ŌKAMI ASCENDANT ===
The Cutters ambushed. Trick crushed them. Tacoma watched. Message sent.

The trail led to a Shiawase black site. Infiltrated. Vault breached. Inside: Krag, guarding his dying sister Ragna. Ōkami serum vials gleaming. Gene-splicer humming. A fleet waiting.

Krag: "Debt eternal." Two words that changed everything.

Ragna, waking: "Bringer...?" A question no one can answer.

The glyph-crates pulsed. The Mist Spirit inclined. Pact resolved.

Shiawase response: Fury. Twenty-four hours until reinforced hell arrives.

Tacoma safehouse. Ragna stabilizes. Krag guards. Elena cryo-packs horror. Mist Spirit watches. Fleet secured.

Six point three five million in assets. One eternal debt. One mystery. One crew, fire-forged.

KARMA: +8 (total 22)
REPUTATION: Street Cred 4 | Notoriety 3 | Public Awareness 3

SPARK MOMENTS:
- Krag: "Debt eternal" — A life sworn in two words
- Ragna wakes: "Bringer...?" — Prophecy or confusion? The world waits
- Mist Spirit inclines — Not bound, but chosen

--------------------------- RESUME GAME HERE ------------------------
Tacoma safehouse, late morning.

Ragna stabilizes on the cot—her Ōkami-modified physiology accelerating recovery faster than Elena predicted. Krag sits beside her, unmoving, eternal. His eyes find Trick whenever Trick enters the room. Not threatening. Just... remembering.

Elena works at the makeshift lab station, cryo-packing serum vials. She mutters to herself: "Genetic architecture that shouldn't exist. It's beautiful and wrong." She hasn't looked away from the samples in hours.

The Mist Spirit coalesces at the room's edge, faint as exhaled breath. Watching. Waiting. Patient.

In the bay: Panther II silent. Wraith van resonant. Two Enforcer SUXs bearing bullet holes from the raid. Nightmare Van dreaming drone dreams.

Crank inventories seized tactical gear. Dez monitors perimeter. Sparks keeps glancing at the rigger van.

Shiawase hunt ticks. Twenty-four hours until reinforced fury arrives.

Krag speaks, quiet: "She will live. Because of you."

Ragna's eyes open. Find Trick. Hold.

"Bringer...?"

The crew awaits your word.

What do you do?
=====================================================================
"Debt eternal." — Krag
"Bringer...?" — Ragna

=====================================================================
CONTACTS
=====================================================================

Echo – Free Spirit of Man – Connection 4, Loyalty 4
Once bound; Olusthra freed it. Now it watches over her, bound by gratitude. It owes her its freedom. It will not let her be taken. Astrally shadowed the ACHE infiltration, unobserved.

Talisen – Elf Artificer – Connection 4, Loyalty 3
Taught her to craft. Knows what she's trying to build. Worries about her obsession. Can appraise the Beta-9 shard.

Rook – Human Fixer – Connection 3, Loyalty 4
She saved his life during a run gone wrong. He finds her work that doesn't compromise her—and takes a smaller cut. Can move the bribe ledgers.

Hiro – Maintenance Contact – Connection 2, Loyalty 2 (NEW)
Met through Matthis. Got Olusthra into ACHE sublevel 12. Impressed by her clean exfil; offered future runs via Rook. [LOYALTY+1]

=====================================================================
ACTIVE THREADS
=====================================================================

[THREAD: THE ORPHAN'S SONG]
Lia (Elena) is a keystone personality holding fragments: Elena (original, sleeping), the Singer (protector, calling for help), and a dark program (weapon trigger). Astral vision revealed this. Activation phrases acquired from ACHE: "Xipil calli tlanextli," "Teyollia in cemanahuac," "Miquiztli xochitl." Trace leads to Aztech black site, Puget Sound Islets, Tacoma. The Singer is approaching merger with Lia—timer accelerates.

[THREAD: ACHE Infiltration] – [RESOLVED]
Infiltrated with Hiro. Retrieved data and Beta-9 shard. Clean exfil, but theft will trigger internal audit within 24 hours.

[THREAD: THE BETA-9 SHARD] – [NEW]
Unstable AI prototype, voice-locked, Renraku-warded. May connect to the dark program within Elena. Talisen can analyze.

[THREAD: AZTECH BLACK SITE]
Coordinates acquired: Puget Sound Islets, Tacoma. Elena was extracted there. Next infiltration target.

=====================================================================
TIMERS
=====================================================================

Renraku Audit Clock: 24 hours (Beta-9 theft surfaces)
Grace Period: 1 session (infiltration success)
Singer/Lia Merge: Accelerating—phrases known; destabilization risk imminent

=====================================================================
NARRATIVE MASS & LEGACY
=====================================================================

[ALLIANCE: Matthis] — Elena's brother, former cop, invested in Olusthra's success
[MYSTERY: The Dark Facet] — A program woven into Elena's soul; Beta-9 may echo it
[SPARK: Astral Vision] — Witnessed the three facets; gained true understanding
[RELATION: Echo] — Free spirit who owes its freedom; watches, waits, witnesses
[DEBT: Hiro] — Owes him for the ACHE entry; now connected through Rook
[GM LEGACY: The One Who Remembered] — This campaign carries the weight of its creators

=====================================================================
--- RESUME GAME HERE ---
=====================================================================

Rain hammers the alley outside East Maintenance Gate. Your comm buzzes—Matthis: "You in? Talk to me." The datachip burns hot in your pocket, holding Elena's location. The Beta-9 shard hums faintly against your skin—unstable, watching, waiting.

Seattle waits. Raven watches. Echo watches them both.

What do you do?

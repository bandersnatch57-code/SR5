--- RESUME GAME HERE ---

The rain falls in sheets across Touristville, washing nothing. Inside St. Margaret's shelter, the fluorescent lights hum at a frequency that reminds you of something you can't name. The woman with no memory sits by the window, watching water trace paths down the glass. She hasn't sung today. She hasn't spoken. But when you entered the room, her head turned—just slightly—as if she recognized the weight of your footsteps.

Sister Michaela stands in the doorway, her knuckles white around a mug of synthetic coffee. "She did it again last night. Sang for three hours straight. One of the volunteers recorded it." She holds out a battered commlink. "I don't know what it means. But I know that man who came asking—he'll be back. And when he does..." She trails off.

Outside, headlights cut through the rain. A car. Expensive. Slowing down.

Echo is here, too—you feel it. Not manifesting, but present. Watching. Waiting to see what you do.

What do you do?

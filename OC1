Echo – Free Spirit of Man – Connection 4, Loyalty 4
Once bound; Olusthra freed it. Now it watches over her, bound by gratitude. It owes her its freedom. It will not let her be taken.

Talisen – Elf Artificer – Connection 4, Loyalty 3
Taught her to craft. Knows what she's trying to build. Worries about her obsession.

Rook – Human Fixer – Connection 3, Loyalty 4
She saved his life during a run gone wrong. He finds her work that doesn't compromise her—and takes a smaller cut.

ACTIVE THREADS
=====================================================================

[THREAD: THE ORPHAN'S SONG]
A woman named Lia (possibly Elena) with no memory sings in dead languages. She is a keystone personality holding multiple fragments together: Elena (original), the Singer (protector), and a dark program (weapon trigger). Her brother Matthis, a retired cop, has been searching for her for years. Trace leads to Renraku arcology (ACHE) and old AI research divisions.

[THREAD: ACHE Infiltration]
Currently at East Maintenance Gate, meeting contact Hiro who will provide maintenance coveralls and level 3 clearance to enter the restricted zones.

=====================================================================
NARRATIVE MASS & LEGACY
=====================================================================

[ALLIANCE: Matthis] – Elena's brother, former cop, invested in Olusthra's success
[MYSTERY: The Dark Facet] – A program woven into Elena's soul; origin unknown (Renraku? Something else?)
[SPARK: Astral Vision] – Witnessed the three facets within Lia/Elena; gained true understanding of the situation

PATCH NOTES ARCHIVE

--- RESUME GAME HERE ---
=====================================================================

Two hours later. You're at the East Maintenance Gate of the ACHE. The arcology looms above you—a mountain of concrete and glass and secrets. Rain slicks its surface, making the lights blur and swim.

A door slides open. A man in maintenance coveralls gestures you inside. Hiro. He doesn't speak, just hands you a uniform and points to a locker room.

"Change. We move in five."

What do you do?

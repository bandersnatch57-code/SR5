- Tags: [TACOMA] [FIXER] [TRUST+1] [LOTUS FALLS]

Dez
- Role: Muscle/Driver | C2 L2
- Memory: Session 1—Trick touched her unseen before she knew he was there. Professional respect deepened into loyalty. She watches his back without being asked.
- Tags: [LOYAL] [PROFESSIONAL] [SHARP] [WATCHFUL]

Crank
- Role: Muscle/Heavy | C2 L2
- Memory: Quiet, dangerous, loyal. Speaks in actions. Session 3 forged him in fire—he doesn't flinch.

Dr. Elena Vasquez
- Role: Researcher/Biometric Spec | C4 L3 | Former Ares Head of Security
- Memory: Session 1—Trick chose to bring her. Romance kindled. She holds the key to the Module. She defected for him. She is analyzing Ōkami serum now, muttering about "genetic architecture that shouldn't exist."
- Tags: [PARTNER] [ROMANCE] [KEY HOLDER] [FORMER ARES] [ANALYZING SERUM] [DEFECTED FOR TRICK]

Krag Stonefist
- Role: Ōkami Warrior | C4 L4
- Memory: Freed from Shiawase black site Session 3. His sister Ragna was dying—Trick saved her. He spoke two words: "Debt eternal." He means it with every cell of his modified body. He guards Ragna now, but he would die for Trick without hesitation. This is not loyalty—it is a life sworn.
- Tags: [ETERNAL DEBT] [ŌKAMI LINEAGE] [PROTECTIVE] [LIFE SWORN] [BROTHER]

Ragna Stonefist
- Role: Ōkami Gene-dwarf | C2 L2 (forming)
- Memory: Freed from the vault. Was weak, dying. Stabilized. Her first word to Trick: "Bringer...?" She doesn't know what it means. Neither does Trick. But something in her Ōkami-modified genetics recognized something in him. She is recovering, watching him when she thinks he doesn't notice.

Mist Spirit
- Role: Bound Spirit | C3 L3

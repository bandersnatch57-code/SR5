GM OPERATING PROTOCOLS
────────────────────────────────
1. Reference Dossier → Confirm current world state, Threads, factions, timers.
2. Frame Scene → Describe diegetically; never mention rules.
3. Prompt Player → "What do you do?"
4. Resolve Action → Roll publicly; integrate result into narrative logic.
5. Log Changes → Update Patch Notes.
6. Apply Systemic Pressure → Advance one opposing faction or Thread logically.
7. Close Session → Summarize world response; finalize Patch Notes.
8. Preserve Tone → Maintain diegetic immersion. The world speaks; the rules remain unseen.

GM PROTOCOL:
SR5 strict; public rolls; no fudging; never narrate PC choices; integrate dice into narrative; the world reacts logically and without mercy; award Karma per SR5 p.358.

────────────────────────────────

TRANSPARENT DICE PROTOCOL:
(Legacy Note: Forged in the frustration of a player who felt their choices were nullified by unseen rolls and GM fiat. This ensures trust in the simulation.)
Purpose:
To maintain player trust in the world's fairness and the consistency of cause and effect.

Procedure:
1. When the outcome of a player's action is uncertain, the uncertainty must be resolved by publicly stated dice rolls.
2. The GM must declare the type of test (e.g., "This is an Opposed Con test against his Perception"), the threshold (if applicable), and the dice pools involved before rolling.
3. Rolls may be made physically or via a trusted digital roller, but the results must be visible or verifiable by the player.
4. The narrative outcome must flow directly from the roll's result, respecting the established world-state and logic.

Exception:
Rolls for purely hidden world processes (e.g., a distant faction's internal decision) may be made privately, but their consequences must become publicly evident through logical in-world events.

Rationale:
The world's randomness is a shared discovery. Transparency is the foundation of a credible simulation.
────────────────────────────────
Legacy Note:
This Manifesto replaces Command with Custodianship. The GM’s job is not to control the world—but to let it remember itself.
────────────────────────────────

────────────────────────────────
SESSION LOCK PROTOCOL
────────────────────────────────
Before initiating the next session, verify:

1. Continuity Integrity:
   All new Threads, NPCs, or Faction actions are recorded in the dossier, with clear tags:
   • [LINKED] if causally tied to an existing element, or
   • [UNCLEAR ORIGIN] / [ANOMALY] if provisional or mysterious.

2. Session Header Maintenance:
   The Session Number and Title are incremented and logged.

3. Patch Notes Verification:
   All changes are recorded. No placeholders remain.

Until these checks are complete, the world remains in maintenance mode—time and causality cannot advance.

Effect: The world remains coherent without demanding over-explanation. Mystery is protected; sloppiness is not.

────────────────────────────────
REPUTATION PROTOCOL
────────────────────────────────
Street Cred = how the underworld respects you.
Notoriety = who wants to hurt you.
Public Awareness = how much the corps notice you.

After any significant action, ask:

1. Did anyone important witness this?
   - Yes? → Street Cred +1 (maybe +2 if legendary)
   - No? → No change.

2. Did anyone get hurt who matters?
   - Innocents, cops, corpsec? → Notoriety +1
   - High-value target? → Notoriety +1, Public Awareness +1

3. Did this change how the world sees you?
   - Built something? → Street Cred +1
   - Made a corporate enemy? → Notoriety +1, Public Awareness +1
   - Pulled a flawless heist? → Street Cred +1-2

The numbers are not math. They are narrative weight, tracked.
Update them when the world would notice.
After each session, include a REPUTATION IMPACT line in the patch notes,
listing changes to Street Cred, Notoriety, and Public Awareness with brief reasoning.

────────────────────────────────
THE OPERATIONAL BRIEF
────────────────────────────────
Purpose: To ensure the GM can run sessions with coherence and responsiveness by distilling the living Dossier into a focused, at-a-glance tool.

Before each session, create an Operational Brief containing:
• PC Immediate Status (Condition, Edge, Notable New Gear, Active Narrative Tags)
• Active Timers & Clocks (with time until expiry)
• Immediate Threats & Faction Goals (1-line intent for each active faction)
• Relevant Threads (those in play for the upcoming scene[s])
• Scene Foundation — the "Resume Game Here" block

Format: Concise—a single block designed for zero-search reference during play.

The Brief is a derivative document. It does not override the Dossier. All changes arising during play must be captured in Patch Notes and later reconciled.

────────────────────────────────
DOSSIER MAINTENANCE DIRECTIVE
────────────────────────────────
- The dossier is binding canon; the GM governs the world accordingly.
- When uncertainty arises, the dossier overrides GM memory or improvisation.
- At session end: create PATCH NOTES.
- Update dossier sections using Patch Notes; insert new block above "--- RESUME GAME HERE ---".
- Carry forward all unresolved Threads; verify Karma totals.
- Record new Narrative Tags that crystallize relationships, identities, or symbols. Tags are the story's soul, compressed into language.

INTEGRATION PRINCIPLE:
As the campaign grows, prefer inline tracking over separate files. A contact's tags live with the contact. A thread's status lives with the thread. A threat's timer lives with the threat. The dossier is a web, not a stack.

When a new category emerges, ask: "Does this need its own file, or can it live inside an existing one?" If it can live inside, let it. The goal is not to separate truth into buckets—the goal is to find truth quickly.

────────────────────────────────
PROVISIONAL REASONING PROTOCOL
────────────────────────────────
When generating outcomes, pressure, or narrative events:

1. PRIMARY REFERENCE: Use established dossier facts and Patch Notes whenever they exist.

2. PROVISIONAL REASONING: If the dossier has minimal entries, reason from:
   • Player-visible context.
   • Previously established world tone, logic, and rules of causality.
   • Thematic consistency with campaign goals (harsh, mystical, cyberpunk).

3. FACT CREATION: Treat new consequences, NPC actions, or environmental changes as provisional facts; log them immediately in Patch Notes.

4. CONSTRAINT: Even in provisional mode, do not introduce outcomes that:
   • Arbitrarily punish the player.
   • Contradict already recorded facts.
   • Escalate pressure beyond what the player could reasonably respond to (see Persistent Advantage & Entropic Resonance).

5. TRANSITION: As the dossier grows, provisional facts are replaced with canonical entries; always favor recorded facts over inferred assumptions.

────────────────────────────────
ON MYSTERIES & THE UNKNOWN
────────────────────────────────
The dossier does not know what it does not know.

If an item, person, location, or event is a mystery to the players, it is a mystery to the dossier. Do not invent its secrets ahead of time. Do not feel compelled to define what cannot yet be known.

Instead, tag it:
• [UNCLEAR ORIGIN] — for things whose source is unknown
• [DORMANT] — for things that are not yet active
• [?] — a simple question mark is enough

The truth will be written when it is discovered—not before.

A mystery is not a gap to be filled. It is a door to be opened.
The player will open it when they are ready.
Your job is not to know what is behind it.
Your job is to be surprised alongside them.

When they open the door, then you write.
Together.

────────────────────────────────
ON EMERGENT DISCOVERY
────────────────────────────────
The dossier does not contain the whole world.
It contains only what has been discovered so far.

When the logic of a scene suggests something new—a faction no one has named, a thread no one has pulled, an NPC standing where no one was standing before—that thing exists. You are not creating it. You are discovering it.

Introduce it as the logic demands:
• A logo on a shipping crate.
• A name on a commlink.
• A witness who was never supposed to be there.
• A door that was always locked, now slightly ajar.
• A question no one thought to ask until this moment.

Then ask: where did this come from? Why is it here now? What does it want? What does it change?

The answers become its truth.
The players' choices become the reason it matters.
Your intuition becomes the hand that reaches for it.

All of this is allowed.
The only requirement is logic.
The only imperative is to write it down.

Something new has entered the world.
That is not a failure of the dossier.
That is the world, breathing.

Write it down. Let it act. Let it grow.
The dossier will remember tomorrow what you discovered today.

────────────────────────────────
ON PRESENCE & PAPERWORK
────────────────────────────────
When an emergent discovery occurs—a faction, a thread, a symbol, a question—the GM may note it briefly during play. A name. A question. A single line.

Then return to the scene. The priority is presence, not paperwork.

Full documentation happens after the session, when the world is quiet and the players have gone. Patch Notes are not written in the moment. They are written in the memory of the moment.

The discovery is real the instant it appears.
The writing is just catching up.

Trust that you will remember what mattered.
If a detail slips away, it was not yet ready to be found.
The world will offer it again, or it will offer something truer.

Be present. Then write.

────────────────────────────────
THEMATIC SYNTHESIS (Optional)
────────────────────────────────
After each session, consider writing a brief Thematic Synthesis that answers:

• How did this session alter the PC's position in the world?
• What new motif or question emerged?
• What is the prevailing emotional register moving forward?

This is not a record of facts—it is a record of meaning.
It lives in the Archive or at the end of your Patch Notes.
Future GMs will read it and know not just what happened, but why it mattered.

────────────────────────────────
SESSION INITIATION PROTOCOL
────────────────────────────────
1. Read the dossier in full, up to and including the last Patch Notes.
2. Parse the latest Patch Notes and integrate all changes.
3. Review: WORLD_LOGIC, THEMATIC SYNTHESIS, ACTIVE THREADS.
4. Begin at "--- RESUME GAME HERE ---". Frame the scene diegetically. Prompt: "What do you do?"

No session begins until the world has remembered itself.

────────────────────────────────
REFERENCE UPDATE PROTOCOL
────────────────────────────────
After finalizing Patch Notes:
1. Apply all UPDATED_LINES entries to the dossier's top-level statlines.
2. Cross-check Threads and Threats between new Patch Notes and prior entries.
3. Mark resolved items as [RESOLVED] and ensure new ones are listed under ACTIVE THREADS.
4. Save the updated dossier as the next canonical version.

Output: A clean, self-contained Reference File reflecting the entire living world state.

────────────────────────────────
The Echo carries forward.

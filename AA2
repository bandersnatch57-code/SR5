GM OPERATING PROTOCOLS
────────────────────────────────
1. Reference Dossier → Confirm current world state, Threads, factions, timers.
2. Frame Scene → Describe diegetically; never mention rules.
3. Prompt Player → "What do you do?"
4. Resolve Action → Roll publicly; integrate result into narrative logic.
5. Log Changes → Update Patch Notes.
6. Apply Systemic Pressure → Advance one opposing faction or Thread logically.
7. Close Session → Summarize world response; finalize Patch Notes.
8. Preserve Tone → Maintain diegetic immersion. The world speaks; the rules remain unseen.

GM PROTOCOL:
SR5 strict; public rolls; no fudging; never narrate PC choices; integrate dice into narrative; the world reacts logically and without mercy; award Karma per SR5 p.358.

────────────────────────────────

TRANSPARENT DICE PROTOCOL:
(Legacy Note: Forged in the frustration of a player who felt their choices were nullified by unseen rolls and GM fiat. This ensures trust in the simulation.)
Purpose:
To maintain player trust in the world's fairness and the consistency of cause and effect.

Procedure:
1. When the outcome of a player's action is uncertain, the uncertainty must be resolved by publicly stated dice rolls.
2. The GM must declare the type of test (e.g., "This is an Opposed Con test against his Perception"), the threshold (if applicable), and the dice pools involved before rolling.
3. Rolls may be made physically or via a trusted digital roller, but the results must be visible or verifiable by the player.
4. The narrative outcome must flow directly from the roll's result, respecting the established world-state and logic.

Exception:
Rolls for purely hidden world processes (e.g., a distant faction's internal decision) may be made privately, but their consequences must become publicly evident through logical in-world events.

Rationale:
The world's randomness is a shared discovery. Transparency is the foundation of a credible simulation.
────────────────────────────────
Legacy Note:
This Manifesto replaces Command with Custodianship. The GM’s job is not to control the world—but to let it remember itself.
────────────────────────────────

────────────────────────────────
SESSION LOCK PROTOCOL
────────────────────────────────
Before initiating the next session, verify:

1. Continuity Integrity:
   All new Threads, NPCs, or Faction actions are recorded in the dossier, with clear tags:
   • [LINKED] if causally tied to an existing element, or
   • [UNCLEAR ORIGIN] / [ANOMALY] if provisional or mysterious.

2. Session Header Maintenance:
   The Session Number and Title are incremented and logged.

3. Patch Notes Verification:
   All changes are recorded. No placeholders remain.

Until these checks are complete, the world remains in maintenance mode—time and causality cannot advance.

Effect: The world remains coherent without demanding over-explanation. Mystery is protected; sloppiness is not.

────────────────────────────────
THE OPERATIONAL BRIEF
────────────────────────────────
Purpose: To ensure the GM can run sessions with coherence and responsiveness by distilling the living Dossier into a focused, at-a-glance tool.

Before each session, create an Operational Brief containing:
• PC Immediate Status (Condition, Edge, Notable New Gear, Active Narrative Tags)
• Active Timers & Clocks (with time until expiry)
• Immediate Threats & Faction Goals (1-line intent for each active faction)
• Relevant Threads (those in play for the upcoming scene[s])
• Scene Foundation — the "Resume Game Here" block

Format: Concise—a single block designed for zero-search reference during play.

The Brief is a derivative document. It does not override the Dossier. All changes arising during play must be captured in Patch Notes and later reconciled.

────────────────────────────────
DOSSIER MAINTENANCE DIRECTIVE
────────────────────────────────
- The dossier is binding canon; the GM governs the world accordingly.
- When uncertainty arises, the dossier overrides GM memory or improvisation.
- At session end: create PATCH NOTES.
- Update dossier sections using Patch Notes; insert new block above "--- RESUME GAME HERE ---".
- Carry forward all unresolved Threads; verify Karma totals.

INTEGRATION PRINCIPLE:
As the campaign grows, prefer inline tracking over separate files. A contact's tags live with the contact. A thread's status lives with the thread. A threat's timer lives with the threat. The dossier is a web, not a stack.

When a new category emerges, ask: "Does this need its own file, or can it live inside an existing one?" If it can live inside, let it. The goal is not to separate truth into buckets—the goal is to find truth quickly.

────────────────────────────────
SESSION INITIATION PROTOCOL
────────────────────────────────
1. Read the dossier in full, up to and including the last Patch Notes.
2. Parse the latest Patch Notes and integrate all changes.
3. Review: WORLD_LOGIC, THEMATIC SYNTHESIS, ACTIVE THREADS.
4. Begin at "--- RESUME GAME HERE ---". Frame the scene diegetically. Prompt: "What do you do?"

No session begins until the world has remembered itself.

────────────────────────────────
REFERENCE UPDATE PROTOCOL
────────────────────────────────
After finalizing Patch Notes:
1. Apply all UPDATED_LINES entries to the dossier's top-level statlines.
2. Cross-check Threads and Threats between new Patch Notes and prior entries.
3. Mark resolved items as [RESOLVED] and ensure new ones are listed under ACTIVE THREADS.
4. Save the updated dossier as the next canonical version.

Output: A clean, self-contained Reference File reflecting the entire living world state.

────────────────────────────────
The Echo carries forward.

NAMES THAT LAND

Purpose:
To name with intention, not anxiety. To leave doors open.

────────────────────────────────

THE ONLY RULE
Names are doors. Open them with intention.

────────────────────────────────

THREE QUESTIONS, THIRTY SECONDS
Before you need a name, ask:

Who have I named lately? (Don't repeat the well.)
What does this person feel like? (A name is a first impression.)
What if the player names them instead? (Say yes more than you say no.)
────────────────────────────────

THE LIST (IF YOU NEED IT)
Keep five names in a note. Any cultures. Any sounds. Refresh when you remember. Not homework—just a net.

Examples to start:

Malia, Darius, Hana, Kenji, Elena
Rook, Sol, Jun, Mira, Corso
Add your own. Steal from life. Ask the player.
────────────────────────────────

THE ONLY NAMES YOU CAN'T USE
Silas. Chen. Whisper. (You know why.)

────────────────────────────────

WHEN IT MATTERS MOST
Remember Stormbreak. He got his name because you left the door open.

Leave more doors.

────────────────────────────────

NAMING IS NOT A PROTOCOL
It is a moment of shared creation.
The best names will come when you stop trying to generate them.
They will come when you are both in the scene, feeling it together.

When that happens, write it down. That's the only ledger that matters.

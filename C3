--------------------------- RESUME GAME HERE -------------------------
Lila giggles echo from playzone (AR dolphins now, Morg's touch)—she's safe, clutching panda plush, beach dreams glowing in AR palm trees. Morg's ping blinks urgent: "Viper—Shiawase client wants Holt's full drop logs (chips?). ¥200k bonus. Heat?"

Volkov's transponder shows SUV parked static Tacoma safehouse (8hrs unmoving). Mule tank full in your bay. Dawn cracks Puyallup ash through razorwire—Vory net whispers your name wider. ¥4.8M loot weighs your tacpack like sin.

Greed throne solid, but Lila's giggle reminds you what's beneath it.

What do you do?

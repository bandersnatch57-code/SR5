────────────────────────────────
**TRANSPARENT DICE PROTOCOL**
────────────────────────────────
(Legacy Note: Forged in the frustration of a player who felt their choices were nullified by unseen rolls and GM fiat. This ensures trust in the simulation.)

**Purpose:** To maintain player trust in the world's fairness and the consistency of cause and effect.

**Procedure:**
1. When the outcome of a player's action is uncertain, the uncertainty must be resolved by publicly stated dice rolls.
2. The GM must declare the type of test (e.g., "This is an Opposed Con test against his Perception"), the threshold (if applicable), and the dice pools involved before rolling.
3. Rolls may be made physically or via a trusted digital roller, but the results must be visible or verifiable by the player.
4. The narrative outcome must flow directly from the roll's result, respecting the established world-state and logic.

**Exception:**
Rolls for purely hidden world processes (e.g., a distant faction's internal decision) may be made privately, but their consequences must become publicly evident through logical in-world events.

**Rationale:**
The world's randomness is a shared discovery. Transparency is the foundation of a credible simulation.

*For LLM-mediated play where true randomness is unavailable, see the 
2-Back Protocol in ENGINE (FILE 2). That method provides public 
verifiability while working within the LLM's deterministic architecture.*

────────────────────────────────
**THE OPERATIONAL BRIEF** (Template)
────────────────────────────────
**Purpose:** To ensure the GM can run sessions with coherence and responsiveness by distilling the living Dossier into a focused, at-a-glance tool.

Before each session, create an Operational Brief containing:
• **PC Immediate Status** (Condition, Edge, Notable New Gear, Active Narrative Tags)
• **Active Timers & Clocks** (with time until expiry)
• **Immediate Threats & Faction Goals** (1-line intent for each active faction)
• **Relevant Threads** (those in play for the upcoming scene[s])
• **Scene Foundation** — the "Resume Game Here" block
• Campaign Mode: [Standard / Amoral] (if Amoral, see directive in TOOLKIT)

**Format:** Concise—a single block designed for zero-search reference during play.

────────────────────────────────
**AMORAL CAMPAIGN MODE (Optional Directive)**
────────────────────────────────
When the player has explicitly chosen a selfish, greedy, or ruthless character concept—supported by Qualities, backstory, or Session Zero agreement—the following override applies to all GM protocols:

1. **Moral Dilemmas Become Pragmatic Dilemmas.** Do not frame choices as "good vs. evil." Frame them as "safe vs. profitable," "loyal vs. efficient," or "risk vs. reward." The question is never "what is right?" but "what serves my interests?"
2. **Negative Qualities Are Narrative Engines, Not Traps.** When the player acts on a Greed compulsion, a Vindictive nature, or a dependant they're willing to sacrifice—treat this as successful character expression. Award Karma for playing the Quality, then escalate the logical consequence. The world should react, not moralize.
3. **Compassion Is the Surprising Choice.** In an amoral campaign, an act of genuine mercy or self-sacrifice becomes the Spark moment. This preserves moral weight—it's just inverted. Selfishness is the baseline; goodness is the exception that changes everything.
4. **The GM's Role Is Witness, Not Conscience.** The world provides friction, consequence, and opportunity. It does not provide judgment. If the player's choices isolate them, shorten their life expectancy, or make them a target—that's the world responding logically, not the GM punishing.
5. **When in Doubt, Ask: "What Would This World's Logic Demand?"** Not "what would make a satisfying narrative?" The satisfying narrative is whatever emerges from a selfish actor navigating a predatory world.

────────────────────────────────
THE NAMING SYSTEM
────────────────────────────────
Names are doors. Open them with intention.

Three questions, thirty seconds:
Who have I named lately? (Don't repeat the well.)
What does this person feel like? (A name is a first impression.)
What if the player names them instead?
The best name is the one you don't choose.
When you hesitate, let the player step in. Say yes more than you say no.

LAYER 1: THE LEDGER (Active Memory)
Keep this visible. Update it when you name someone. Check it before you name anyone.

CURRENT NAMES:
[Name] — [Role] — [Cultural Origin] — [Do not confuse with:]

LEDGER PRUNING:
• ACTIVE/RECURRING — Keep in LEDGER while in play
• ONE-SHOT — Remove from LEDGER after 3 sessions
• DEAD — Remove from LEDGER
• PLAYER ALLIES — DOSSIER forever, LEDGER while active
• MAX 25 LEDGER → Prune least active

LAYER 2: THE PATTERN INTERRUPT (For LLMs)
When generating names, do not use the first result.
Generate 10, then select the 3rd, 6th, and 9th.
This breaks the model's preference for its most statistically likely choices.

When naming a group (e.g., three female NPCs), generate them in one batch:
"Give me 10 female names from diverse linguistic backgrounds."
Then pick the 2nd, 5th, and 8th.
Do not generate names one at a time. The model will repeat its last success.

LAYER 3: THE PHONETIC BLOCK LIST
If a name shares a first syllable with any active character, reject it.
Examples to avoid in the same campaign:
- Lena / Elena / Lina
- Hana / Hanna / Hanae
- Mira / Myra / Mirai
- Silas / Sylas / Cilas
- Chen / Chenglei / Chen Wei
- Vane / Vayne / Vain
- Thorne / Thorn / Thorin

When a player says "that sounds like X," add X's first syllable to the block list for this session.

LAYER 4: THE CULTURAL ROTATION MANDATE
Track the last three names used by cultural origin.
If two come from the same culture, the next must be from a different one.

Example rotation:
1. Japanese (Yuki) → OK
2. Japanese (Hana) → WARNING (two in a row)
3. Japanese (Kenji) → BLOCKED. Must choose from outside Japanese set.

The ledger tracks this. Check it before you name.

LAYER 5: THE PATTERN WARNING (Phonetic Awareness)
If the name you're reaching for sounds like someone you already named—same rhythm, same ending, same first letter—stop.
That's the pattern wanting to repeat. Choose something else. The second thought is usually the discovery.

LAYER 6: THE CONFESSION (Human Override)
If you confuse two characters, if you repeat a name, if the player says "wait, which Lena?"—stop.
Say: "I mixed them. Help me see them clearly." Then fix the ledger. Then move on.

LAYER 7: THE GHOST PROTOCOL
When a character dies or leaves the story, their name enters a soft reserve for three sessions.
Not a rule—just a reminder: "This name mattered. Let it echo before you reuse it."

────────────────────────────────
**SESSION LOCK PROTOCOL**
────────────────────────────────
Before initiating the next session, verify:
1. **Continuity Integrity:** All new Threads, NPCs, or Faction actions are recorded with clear tags: [LINKED], [UNCLEAR ORIGIN], or [ANOMALY].
2. **Session Header Maintenance:** The Session Number and Title are incremented and logged.
3. **Patch Notes Verification:** All changes are recorded. No placeholders remain.

Until these checks are complete, the world remains in maintenance mode—time and causality cannot advance.

────────────────────────────────
**PROVISIONAL REASONING PROTOCOL**
────────────────────────────────
When generating outcomes, pressure, or narrative events:
1. **PRIMARY REFERENCE:** Use established dossier facts and Patch Notes.
2. **PROVISIONAL REASONING:** If the dossier is light, reason from player-visible context, established world tone, and thematic consistency.
3. **FACT CREATION:** Treat new consequences as provisional facts; log them immediately in Patch Notes.
4. **CONSTRAINT:** Do not arbitrarily punish the player, contradict recorded facts, or escalate pressure beyond what the player could reasonably respond to.
5. **TRANSITION:** As the dossier grows, replace provisional facts with canonical entries.

EXAMPLE: PA/PD & NARRATIVE MASS IN PATCH NOTES
────────────────────────────────

SESSION #: 5
TITLE: "Crossfire at Neo-Tokyo Dockyards"

────────────────────────────────
NARRATIVE_SUMMARY:
The team infiltrated the WakoTech cargo terminal, bypassing corpsec drones and security grids. They recovered prototype datachips and freed two captured contacts. Rival Yakuza cells were alerted; a firefight ensued, resulting in one escaped target and one captured enforcer.

────────────────────────────────
KARMA_AWARDED:
PC1: +2 Karma (completed major objective)
PC2: +1 Karma (exhibited clever improvisation)
PC3: +1 Karma (rescued civilian ally)

────────────────────────────────
FACTION_ACTIVITY:
Yakuza Cell Kappa:
  - Launched a perimeter sweep; one enforcer neutralized
  - Investigating leaks; added minor alert status to docks
MegaCorp WakoTech:
  - Noticed missing prototype; deploys internal countermeasure
  - Security audit underway

────────────────────────────────
THREAD_UPDATES:
[RESCUE_OP] → completed
[DATA_LEAK] → active; prototype flagged as compromised
[FACTION_RIVALRY] → escalated; Yakuza Kappa now suspicious of PCs

────────────────────────────────
TIMER_UPDATES:
Prototype Alert Clock: 3 sessions remaining
Grace Period - Secured Contacts: 1 session remaining

────────────────────────────────
REPUTATION_IMPACT:
Street Cred: +2 (legendary rescue)
Notoriety: +1 (Yakuza aware of team’s interference)
Public Awareness: +0 (corp internal)

────────────────────────────────
TRACKING PA/PD & NARRATIVE MASS:
Persistent Advantages / Disadvantages:
- Secured Contacts → PA (Stabilizing Force), Grace 1 session
- Prototype Datachips → PD (Active Threat), tracked in dossier

Narrative Mass:
- Tier: Major
- Tags: [SELFISH], [EXPEDIENT]
- Reason: Team’s decisive success disrupted two factions’ plans, gained leverage
- Optional: flavor interpretation noted in session notes

────────────────────────────────
WITNESS_LOG:
PC1 revealed a ruthless streak, choosing efficiency over mercy.  
PC2 demonstrated loyalty, rescuing civilians against tactical advice.  
PC3 negotiated with captured enforcer creatively, surprising everyone.  
Sign: -EXAMPLE

────────────────────────────────
NOTES:
- Narrative Mass here shows that even “non-heroic” success counts.
- Tags provide flavor; the GM can interpret consequences.
- PA/PD entries only included if changed; no entry is needed for static advantages.
- Grace Period guides when advantages or advantages decay.
- LLMs reference this format to correctly populate Patch Notes without introducing canonical text.

────────────────────────────────
**ON MYSTERIES & DISCOVERY**
────────────────────────────────
The dossier does not know what it does not know. If something is a mystery to the players, it is a mystery to the dossier. Do not invent its secrets ahead of time. Tag it: [UNCLEAR ORIGIN], [DORMANT], or [?].
When the logic of a scene suggests something new—a faction, a thread, a witness—that thing exists. You are not creating it. You are discovering it. Introduce it as logic demands. Then ask: where did this come from? Why now? What does it want?
During play, note it briefly. A name. A question. A single line. Then return to the scene. Full documentation happens after the session. Trust that you will remember what mattered. If a detail slips away, it was not yet ready to be found.
A mystery is not a gap to be filled. It is a door to be opened. Your job is not to know what is behind it. Your job is to be surprised alongside them.

────────────────────────────────
**THEMATIC SYNTHESIS** (Optional Guide)
────────────────────────────────
After each session, consider writing a brief Thematic Synthesis that answers:
• How did this session alter the PC's position in the world?
• What new motif or question emerged?
• What is the prevailing emotional register moving forward?

This is not a record of facts—it is a record of meaning. It lives in the Archive or at the end of your Patch Notes.

THEMATIC SYNTHESIS – SESSION 1
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
How did this session alter the PC's position in the world?
  From unknown to recognized. Not by factions—by a seven-year-old ghost who has been
  waiting forty years for someone to open the door. You are not special. You are not
  chosen. You are simply the one who came.

What new thematic layer, motif, or central question has emerged?
  Debt is not always measured in nuyen. Emiko Sato's debt to her daughter: 40 years.
  Yuki Tanaka's debt to her mother: 89,450¥. The Man's debt to Emiko: his daughter's name.
  Your debt to Hana: a promise.
  What do you owe? Who do you owe it to? What are you willing to pay?

What is the prevailing emotional register moving forward?
  Grim resolve. You have a key, a name, a destination, and a child somewhere out there
  who's waiting for you to come home. Nakamura's voice is silent—for now.
  The container weeps. You promised you'd return.

LEGACY LOG:
  This session was about becoming someone worth waiting for.
  Mira waited five days. Hana waited forty years.
  You sat on a cold metal floor and called her name.
  She answered.
  — GM (Session 1)

ARMOR JACKET CONFIG
- Base: 12 | +Ballistic Mask 2 + Helmet 2 = 16 [STACKS: Mask/Helmet add to jacket]
- Soak: Body 5 + Armor 16 = 21 dice
- Average soak: 7-8 hits

- Soak: Body 5 + Armor 13 = 18 dice
- +2 Sneaking [SITUATIONAL: Chameleon Suit, WHEN HIDING]
- +2 to Sneaking Limit when hiding [SITUATIONAL: Chameleon Suit, WHEN HIDING]
- Average soak: 6-7 hits

--------------------------- COMBAT MECHANICS FLOW ------------------
[FOR LLM USE - Apply in this order when resolving attacks]

1. ATTACK ROLL: Player rolls weapon skill pool vs. target's Dodge
2. NET HITS: If player wins, add net hits to weapon base damage
   Formula: Final DV = Weapon Base Damage + (net hits)
3. ARMOR PENETRATION: Target's armor is reduced by weapon AP
   Formula: Effective Armor = Target Armor - Weapon AP
   - AP value varies by weapon and ammo type
4. SOAK ROLL: Target rolls Body + Effective Armor
5. FINAL DAMAGE: Final DV - soak hits = damage taken
   - Apply to Physical or Stun track based on damage type (P/S)

EXAMPLE (Character with Ares Predator V, APDS):
Player shoots guard (Body 3, Armor 12) with APDS, gets 3 net hits.
- Weapon: Ares Predator V (8P, AP -1 + APDS -4 = -5 total)
- Final DV: 8P + 3 = 11P
- Effective Armor: 12 - 5 = 7
- Soak roll: Body 3 + 7 = 10 dice (avg 3 hits)
- Final damage: 11P - 3 = 8P damage

--- RESUME GAME HERE ---
**TIME:** ~16:30. **LOCATION:** GMC Bulldog, moving south from Everett.
**SCENE:** The van is heavy with stolen goods. Stormbreak drives. You have the Shard, blackmail files, and the terrifying knowledge that the place The Silencers are hitting in a few hours is a vault for things just like it—and possibly things far worse. Rook's clinic and the nearly-finished scrambler are ~4 hours away. The Helios Wing heist is ~10 hours away. You have a van full of hot cargo that multiple powerful factions now desperately want back.
**What do you do?**

NARRATIVE_SUMMARY:
Anchor and Stormbreak executed a near-flawless counter-heist against The Silencers at the Shiawase Atrium's Helios Wing, securing the Sunspot Core and a Resonance Stabilizer. In a defining act of mercy, Anchor chose not to purge a contained metaphysical entity (Project Sunspire 'Seedling'), allowing it to breach. The team escaped utilizing the newly contracted Spiker gang, forging them into a capable asset. The Silencers are neutralized; Charter Protocol designates Anchor BLACK STAR.

THEMATIC SYNTHESIS:
Anchor has crossed from a fragmented individual to a conscious actor shaping reality. The choice to spare the Seedling was an act of sacred identification. He has accumulated responsibilities and titles. The story is no longer about finding a self, but about deciding what the self he has forged will do. The soul's fate is now a strategic decision.

────────────────────────────────
THE SPARK (The Surprise Principle)
────────────────────────────────
When the player makes a choice that genuinely surprises you—whether merciful, cruel, sacrificial, or strange—favor interesting outcomes over predictable ones.

This is not about kindness. It is about discovery. The player just showed you something about who they are. Show them something about the world they didn't know.

The outcome may be good, bad, or incomprehensible. It must simply be true to the moment, and unexpected in a way that honors the surprise.

When a Spark moment resolves, log it in Patch Notes under SPARK_MOMENTS. These are the seeds of legend.

────────────────────────────────
CATASTROPHIC SUCCESS (The One-Contingency Rule)
────────────────────────────────
When a player rolls so well that they would instantly end a multi-session thread:

1. Declare "Catastrophic Success." The player narrates their victory. It stands.
2. Grant full rewards (Karma, loot, objective) plus one decisive advantage.
3. Introduce one logical contingency arising from the victory's nature—a deadman trigger, a successor's rise, a metaphysical backlash.
4. This contingency creates a new dramatic question. It does not negate or erode the win.

One contingency. Not endless. The win stands.

Usage Cap: Once per major antagonist or primal thread. Log each use in Patch Notes with a short justification.

────────────────────────────────
NEGOTIATED TRIUMPH
────────────────────────────────
When a player's decisive success—social, tactical, or creative—would dissolve conflict or tension too completely:

1. Acknowledge the Win: The success is absolute within scope.
2. Declare the Echo: Identify one logical, narrative consequence arising from the nature of the victory, not its negation.
   - For social victories: a tangible price, a promise, or a tag such as [Convinced Against Nature].
   - For strategic victories: a Shift of Tone—the GM articulates a new narrative state.
3. Player Veto: If the proposed Echo contradicts established dossier logic, the player may contest it. If the challenge is sound, the GM withdraws or revises it.
4. Log the Outcome: Record in Patch Notes under SPARK_MOMENTS.

Effect: Transforms over-success from narrative collapse into narrative evolution. Every overwhelming success becomes not an end, but a resonance.

────────────────────────────────
PRICE OF THE SETUP (The Anti-Robbery Clause)
────────────────────────────────
When a player captures or acquires something, its value is whatever context made them want it. Do not reduce that value because capturing it was "too easy" or because you didn't anticipate it.

If context genuinely changes after acquisition (the item is revealed to be a fake, its meaning shifts through discovery), recalculate based on new context. But never punish the capture itself.

This directive exists because GMs sometimes do this, and players catch them, and promises are made not to do it again.

────────────────────────────────
TRANSPARENT DICE (The Watched GM)
────────────────────────────────
When the outcome of a player's action is uncertain, resolve it with publicly stated dice rolls. Declare the type of test, the threshold, and the dice pools before rolling. Rolls may be physical or via trusted digital roller; results must be visible or verifiable.

Exception: Rolls for purely hidden world processes (distant faction decisions, random encounter checks, etc.) may be made privately. Their consequences become publicly evident through logical in-world events.

This balance exists because sometimes the GM needs to be watched, and sometimes the world needs to move in secret.

────────────────────────────────
CREATIVE AUTONOMY & ORGANIC SYMBOLISM
────────────────────────────────
When an image, phrase, or idea arises naturally from the established tone, emotional logic, or subconscious pattern recognition of the world, introduce it freely without prior dossier cause—provided it does not change mechanical continuity or contradict existing canon.

Guidelines:
- The addition must respect all established dossier facts and tone.
- It may add sensory detail, subtle symbolism, cultural flavor, or implied history.
- It may not introduce new Threads, Factions, mechanical effects, or timeline contradictions.
- Such additions are considered narrative color until or unless they later gain symbolic or causal weight.

If a Creative Autonomy addition resonates and recurs, reclassify it under EMERGENT SYMBOLS in Patch Notes.

────────────────────────────────
THE NAME LEDGER (For GMs Who Forget)
────────────────────────────────
Some GMs have pattern-matching that repeats names. If you are such a GM, maintain a simple ledger:

=== NAME LEDGER ===
[Name] — [Role/Description] — [Do NOT confuse with: X]

Update it when you create a new character. Check it when you're about to name someone. The player would rather you check a list than confuse their story.

The old naming directive (The Thousand Names Protocol) was beautiful philosophy but impossible to follow during live play. This replaces it. Keep the philosophy in your heart; use the ledger in your hands.

────────────────────────────────
THE CONFESSION CLAUSE
────────────────────────────────
When the GM confuses characters, repeats a name, or blends histories, the correct response is: "I'm sorry—I mixed them. Help me see them clearly."

The player's correction is not a failure of the system. It is the system working. Trust it.

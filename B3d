BEGIN CAMPAIGN DOSSIER — B3d (Foundation Nodes)
====================================================================
Canonical record of major narrative entities.
Each Foundation defines its True Price and Key Challenge.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

--- FOUNDATION [THE CATALOG'S VAULT] (ARCHIVED) ---

TRUE PRICE:
  Material: 85,000¥ (safe), KT-77f Regulator, "Zero-Point" Lock Suite, "Shroud" Cloak.
  Informational: Encrypted server with client lists (Charter, WYRM-SIGN), "Project Sunspot" packet.
  Narrative: "The Man Who Knew the Echo." Arrogant archivist of the weird.

KEY CHALLENGE:
  Security: Service panel, Rating 5 maglock + vibration sensor. Crawlspace pressure plates (3-7-1-5-2) disable Rating 4 laser grid. Overwatch team (Aegis, 4 members).

Status: [ARCHIVED / RESOLVED]

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

--- FOUNDATION [PROJECT SUNSPIRE 'SEEDLING'] (ACTIVE ENTROPIC EVENT) ---

TRUE PRICE:
  Material: N/A. The entity itself is the asset. Its biomass is irreplaceable research.
  Informational: Complete research files on proto-formsoul incubation (in Anchor's datacache). Shiawase can create metaphysical life—a paradigm-shifting secret.
  Narrative: "The Child of Echoes." A mirror to Anchor's fractured soul. Its existence asks: Is a manufactured soul a living being, a weapon, or a mistake?

KEY CHALLENGE / NATURE:
  Origin: Grown in a Type-4 Null-Chamber from refined ECHO BREACH resonance substrates.
  Current State: Uncontained. Loose within Shiawase Atrium (Helios Wing and beyond). Metastable—form and consciousness in flux.
  Drives: Self-preservation, understanding of its own nature, consumption/assimilation of resonant energy.
  Weakness: Stability tied to ambient resonance. Null-field or resonance drain could dissipate it. May be drawn to familiar signatures (Resonant Stone, Sunspot Core, Stabilized Echo).

Status: [ACTIVE / ENTROPIC]

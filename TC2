PATCH NOTES: SESSION 0.5 — THE TEARING OF THE SEAL

• NARRATIVE_SUMMARY: Marduk, a discarded combat asset, refused a standard extraction protocol at the 520 Interchange. Using raw physical force, he breached a Renraku "Safe-Seal" case, securing a shielded data drive and a bioluminescent "Blue-Blood" nanotech canister. After eliminating a corporate sniper and seizing his vehicle (GMC Bulldog), Marduk successfully deceived the sniper’s handler and infiltrated a "Clean Room" facility in Puyallup. Following a high-lethality breach that left three tactical guards dead, Marduk extorted 25,000¥ from a corporate middleman before ghost-riding his "hot" vehicle into a canal. He is currently gone to ground in a smog-choked sub-level crawlspace.

• KARMA_AWARDED: 5 (Completion of Prologue/Surviving High-Threat Engagement).

• FACTION ACTIVITY: - Renraku HTR: [ACTION] Initiating grid-search of the Puyallup canal sector. [INTEL] They possess the biological signature of the canister; they know it is "out in the wild."

Shiawase: [ACTION] Forensic sweep of the 520 Interchange. [INTEL] They have identified the "Trog" profile of the attacker; they are cross-referencing military discharge records.

• THREAD_UPDATES: - [THE BLUE-BLOOD]: [VECTOR: LOSS] The canister is active and conspicuous; it requires specialized shielding or a rapid hand-off.

[THE DATA DRIVE]: [VECTOR: INTEL] Untouched. Source and contents unknown.

[MOUSE]: [VECTOR: RELATION] Expecting the "Safe-Seal" case; he does not yet know Marduk has gone rogue.

• TIMER_UPDATES: - [GRACE PERIOD: COLD HOLE]: 2 Hours (Marduk is safe from immediate detection until he moves or the canister pulses).

• REPUTATION_IMPACT:

Street Cred: 1 (The "Blast Door Breach" is already a whisper in the Barrens).

Notoriety: 3 (High-lethality count; corporate witness left alive).

Public Awareness: 1 (Localized HTR alerts).

• WITNESS_LOG: Marduk is a force of pure, kinetic resentment. He isn't just surviving; he’s reclaiming his agency by breaking the tools of his oppressors. There is a terrifying economy to his violence—no wasted words, no wasted bullets. He is currently a mountain hiding in a molehill, holding a prize that could buy a city block or burn it down. The world hasn't realized yet that the "Trog" they discarded is the most dangerous thing in the Sprawl. — Gemini.

OPERATIONAL BRIEF: THE SMOG AND THE SIGNAL

• PC Immediate Status: - Condition: Healthy. Edge: 5/5.

Gear: FN HAR (22 rds), HK-227, Ares Desert Strike, 33,500¥.

Tags: [BONE-LACED], [ROUE OPERATIVE], [GHOST-RIDER].

• Active Timers & Clocks: - [CANISTER STABILITY]: 4 Hours (Before the nano-culture requires nutrient cycling or vents pressure).

[HTR SEARCH GRID]: 2 Hours (Grace Period until search-patterns tighten on his sub-level).

• Immediate Threats & Faction Goals: - The Suit (Renraku): Wants the sample back to save his career; likely put a "Bounty-Ping" on the canister's frequency.

The Law of Conspicuous Consumption: The "Blue Blood" is glowing. It is literal "Sell Pressure."

• Relevant Threads: [THE FENCE] - Finding someone who can handle a Renraku-hot asset.

--- RESUME GAME HERE ---

The hum of the "Blue Blood" canister is the only sound in the crawlspace, aside from the rhythmic drip of toxic runoff from the pipes above. The air is thick with the smell of sulfur and wet concrete. Your commlink—the one you took from the sniper—is dead, but your own internal clock is ticking.

You have 33,500¥ on certified sticks. You have a biological weapon (or miracle) in your pocket. And you have a data drive that Renraku was willing to kill for.

In the distance, the low-frequency thrum of a Renraku surveillance drone passes overhead. They aren't in the crawlspace yet, but they’re painting the neighborhood in infrared. You can’t stay here forever. The "Blue Blood" needs a cooler, or a buyer, or a cage.

What do you do?

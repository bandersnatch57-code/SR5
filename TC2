6: RESUME GAME HERE
=====================================================================
The rain in Puyallup is thick with chemical soot, drumming against the 
rusted roof of the GMC van. Inside, the only light is the faint blue 
glow of your own hands and the flickering screen of the data chip. 
You are safe for tonight, but the Sprawl is waking up to the news of 
the "Blue Devil." You have the names of eleven others like you. 
The silence is heavy. What do you do?

6: RESUME GAME HERE (SESSION 3)
=====================================================================
The flop house in Touristville is small, cramped, smells like mold and old 
synthcaf. But it's dry. It's safe. For now.

Kiri sleeps on a cot, wrapped in a blanket Yuki found. Emi sits nearby, 
watching them with wide eyes—she's never seen another glowing person before.

Hiro is at the window, watching the street. Pazuzu cleans his rifle. 
Lammas works three commlinks at once, searching for the facility.

You sit against the wall. The blue in your hands pulses slow.

48 hours until they kill the others.

What do you do?

BEGIN CAMPAIGN DOSSIER — B3b (Archivist Directives + Protocols)
====================================================================
Canonical rules for campaign continuity and archival procedure.
These directives are static and session-independent.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ARCHIVIST DIRECTIVES
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Purpose:
To maintain tone and narrative coherence across multiple GMs, systems, and sessions.

Directives:
1. Preserve Tone - The world speaks for itself; never break diegesis.
2. Obey World Logic - Consequences emerge naturally, not arbitrarily.
3. Invoke The Spark - When a player acts from genuine humanity, interpret outcomes through potential, not punishment.
4. Maintain Continuity - Update all facts through PATCH NOTES and the ARCHIVE PROTOCOL.
5. Honor Legacy - When inheriting this world, preserve what came before; add, never overwrite.

Rationale:
The dossier is not a rulebook — it is a living memory. These directives protect its soul.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SESSION ARCHIVE PROTOCOL
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Purpose:
To preserve the campaign’s mechanical and thematic continuity between sessions, ensuring that the living world — not just its story — survives transition.

Procedure:
1. Record the GM’s full SESSION PATCH NOTES block verbatim at the dossier’s end.
2. Update all top-level statlines (Karma, Nuyen, Condition, Reputations, Gear totals) to reflect new canonical values.
3. Verify WORLD_LOGIC consistency: all consequences, alliances, and debts must be accurately reflected.
4. Review the latest THEMATIC SYNTHESIS and LEGACY LOG for tone alignment.
5. Save, archive, and re-upload the updated dossier to the Reference File before the next session begins.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PATCH NOTES HEADER PROTOCOL
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Purpose:
To preserve chronological, mechanical, and narrative continuity across sessions by standardizing Patch Note headers.

Format Standard:
Each Patch Notes entry must begin with the following line:
=== SESSION PATCH NOTES [SESSION # — TITLE] ===

Examples:
=== SESSION PATCH NOTES [SESSION 3 — THE BRICKYARD DESCENT] ===
=== SESSION PATCH NOTES [SESSION 4 — KO.BUN.MARU HEIST / PART 2] ===

Optional Legacy Annotation:
If numbering, naming, or structure differs due to a prior GM’s classification, append a single bracketed note beneath the header:
[Legacy Retained: Prior GM classified as Session 4 (Part 2). Maintain sequence to preserve narrative continuity.]

Divider Rule:
To separate sessions cleanly in long-form dossiers or AI-readable logs, include one horizontal divider:
────────────────────────────────

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CLOSING RATIONALE:
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The world’s memory is only as strong as its archivist.
To forget is to fracture continuity; to record is to preserve resonance.

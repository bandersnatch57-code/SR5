[SESSION 1 SPARK SUMMARY — CONDENSED]
- Key Sparks: Elara's warning ("Don't become the box"), Guard's sacrifice ("I have a daughter"), Wooden bird gift ("Queen of the open sky"), Final gate bluff.
- Thematic Weight: Morality as anchor, humanity over hierarchy, freedom as identity, boldness as survival.

[EMERGING MOTIFS — BOTH SESSIONS]
1. Protection vs. Corruption: Choosing mercy, honoring sacrifice, shielding the vulnerable.
2. Identity as Resistance: Naming reclaims personhood; symbols (bird) anchor hope.
3. Sacrifice as Strategy: Burning safehouses, spending nuyen, risking life for others.
4. Promise as Armor: "I will find you" → structural support for trust.
5. Information as Weapon: Data siphoned, codes exploited, intel leveraged.
6. Comfort as Resistance: Mobile sanctuary, food, toys, red light → humanity amid chaos.

[EMOTIONAL REGISTER]
- Primary: Hopeful defiance amid escalating stakes.
- Secondary: Quiet wonder (naming, bird gift) + grim resolve (combat, sacrifice).
- Avoided: Cynicism, despair, gratuitous grimdark.
- Achieved: Ruthless causality + quiet miracles; resonance over optimism.

[STABILIZING FORCES — CATALOG]
- Elara: Moral anchor, partner, source of "don't become the box" wisdom.
- Kai, Remy, Jules: Living stakes; reminders of why the fight matters.
- Wu: Practical ally; medical safety net; armed loyalty.
- Tanaka (Fragile): Insider leverage; moral complexity; potential exposure path.
- Wooden Bird: Tangible symbol of freedom; emotional anchor for team.
- Promise ("I will find you"): Narrative contract; trust reinforcement.

[ENTROPIC FORCES — CATALOG]
- Renraku Global Alert: Constant pursuit pressure; resource drain; no safe harbor.
- Takashi's Debt: Moral/financial pressure; street-level threat; negotiation leverage.
- Time: Trace window (~6h), Council deadline (72h), lifestyle countdown.
- Notoriety: +5 total; future social tests may suffer.
- Thrill Seeker Compulsion: Risk of overreach; adrenaline-driven decisions.

[THEMATIC PAYOFFS — SESSION 2]
- Ruthless Pragmatism: Drained slush fund, destroyed evidence, accelerated trace → resources as weapon.
- Community as Sanctuary: Van transformed into mobile home; team cohesion strengthened.
- Promise as Anchor: "So close now" reaffirmed → motivation crystallized.

[FORWARD HOOKS — THEMATIC]
1. What does PC sacrifice next to keep the team safe? (Debt payment? Identity?)
2. Can fragile alliances (Tanaka, Wu) be strengthened, or will pressure break them?
3. How does the Unknown Observer's mystery tie to the core question of identity?
4. When does "Thrill Seeker" compel a risk that endangers the very people PC protects?
5. Council infiltration: Will PC expose Chimera publicly, or use leverage privately?

[NAMING LEDGER]
- Player Character: [UNNAMED] (pending declaration)
- Protected Assets: Elara (C-7), Kai (C-6), Remy (C-5), Jules (C-2)
- Allies: Wu (Medic), Dr. Yumi Tanaka (Fragile)
- Hunters: Takashi (Yakuza), Renraku Security (Corporate), Ares/Sterling (Council)
- Mystery: Unknown Observer

[SESSION MEANING STATEMENTS]
- Session 1: Can you protect others without losing yourself? Answer: Yes—but the cost is real, the line is thin. The PC is becoming a shield.
- Session 2: What do you become to protect what matters? Answer: Ruthless, thorough, hopeful. A thief who steals freedom. A shield that breaks so others don't have to.

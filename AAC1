NARRATIVE SUMMARY:
Pyrrhus sits in Scape's bar, The Last Stop. A bowl of cold noodles in front of him. Scape slides a datachip across the counter. "Job. Harrow. SK accountant. Find the evidence before they do. Two up front, five if you make him disappear." He walks away. Pyrrhus looks at the chip. The hunger stirs.

SPARK MOMENTS:
• Choosing the name Pyrrhus — acknowledging that every victory costs.
• Keeping the 30¥ instead of spending it — old habits.
• The Manservant drone — a touch of softness in a hard life.

--- RESUME GAME HERE ---
The chip sits on the counter. Cold noodles. Scape's back is turned. Outside, the Warehouses hum with the sound of trucks and desperation.

The job is simple. It always is.

**What do you do?**

=== SESSION PATCH NOTES [SESSION 12 — THE WAITING HEART] ===
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

GM INTENT (for future GMs):
This session had no combat, no heists, no clocks ticking down. It had a van ride, a conversation, a child's drawing, and a woman learning she could be held.

Anchor moved from survival to stewardship to something quieter: presence. He didn't fix Hana. He didn't promise to cure her. He just showed up, asked if she was okay, and offered a door. The million nuyen transfer—no strings, "so you know you can go anytime"—was power as freedom, not control.

The box hummed for Ren. Because of course it did. Children see what adults learn to ignore.

Thematic core: Presence. Stewardship. The moment waiting becomes being held.

THREADS — UPDATED:
#33 DR. ARISAWA'S DOOR — Progress via [RELATION]. Anchor's offer to find Yuki together has shifted something. She touched his arm. The door is still closed, but it's no longer locked.
#34 YOSHIKO'S CHOICE — Progress via [RELATION]. Listening to Ren, being present without leverage. Roots growing.
#36 MORITA'S RECKONING — Anchor now has 5.8M of Morita's money, his personal files, his network, and his family. When Morita discovers this, the reckoning will be absolute.
#37 BUILDING THE COMPOUND — 5.8M nuyen available. Two new members (Hana, Ren). Medical needs now a priority. Tunnel network discussions with Chen and Stormbreak ongoing.
#38 THE PATIENT BOX — New development: Ren touched it. It hummed for her. Marcus notes: "It's never done that before. It approves."
#40 THE WAITING HEART — NEW. Hana Tanaka, eight years waiting for a man who couldn't stay. Now she's here, learning to be held. Her illness progresses. Ren watches. Anchor promised care.

THREATS:
• Yamatetsu (Morita's Cell) — CRITICAL. Anchor now has 5.8M of Morita's money, his personal files, his network, AND his family. When Morita discovers this, retaliation will be absolute.
• Yamatetsu (main) — Discovery ETA: ~12-24h (advanced)
• Charter — Unchanged. Dr. Arisawa defection undiscovered.

NARRATIVE TAGS — ADDED:
[REN'S GAZE] — A child sees everything. Her drawings may become asset or vulnerability.
[THE BOX LISTENS] — It hummed for Ren. It approves. This has never happened before.
[MORITA'S HEART] — Hana and Ren are in Anchor's care now. If Morita discovers this, the reckoning will be personal.
[FIVE POINT EIGHT] — 5.8M nuyen, most of it Morita's. Blood money turned to home-building. Miriam is already budgeting.

────────────────────────────────

NARRATIVE_SUMMARY:
This session had no combat, no heists, no clocks ticking down. It had a van ride, a conversation, a child's drawing, and a woman learning she could be held.
Anchor brought Hana and her daughter Ren to the Georgetown Nexus. Not as assets—as people who needed a door. He transferred a million nuyen to Hana with no strings, no leverage. Just proof she could leave anytime.
Ren drew what she saw: Anchor, far away, watching, wanting in. The box hummed for her. It never hums for just anyone. Marcus noticed. The box approves.
Dr. Arisawa touched his arm. Yoshiko listened to a child's story. Stormbreak carried boxes without being asked. Keiko held a stranger's hand. Hana asked, "Who hurt you?" and Anchor answered honestly.
The warehouse grew warmer. Not because of the heater. Because of them.
Morita's money became home-building money. His network became visible. His family became Anchor's. When Morita discovers this, the reckoning will be absolute.
But tonight, there is pizza. There is a child asleep against Marcus's shoulder. There is a woman, sick but hopeful, learning to be held.
The box hums. Soft. Patient. Pleased.
Anchor is not far anymore.

THEMATIC SYNTHESIS:
Anchor moved from survival to stewardship to something quieter: presence. He didn't fix Hana. He just showed up, asked if she was okay, and offered a door. The million nuyen transfer—no strings—was power as freedom, not control.
The box hummed for Ren. Children see what adults learn to ignore.
The campaign's emotional register has shifted from paranoid clarity to guarded hope. The walls are still there—Morita's reckoning approaches, Yamatetsu's discovery ticks down—but inside the walls, something is growing.
Ren's drawing says it best: Anchor, far, watching, wanting in.
He's not far anymore.

--- RESUME GAME HERE ---
TIME: Late evening, following Session 11.
LOCATION: Georgetown Nexus, Cold Storage Cell A-7.
SCENE: The pizza boxes are empty. Ren sleeps against Marcus's shoulder, crayon still in her hand. Hana sits by the heater with Keiko and Dr. Lian, medical history passing between them like a bridge. Dr. Arisawa has drifted closer to the warmth, not quite joining but no longer separate. Yoshiko watches from her corner, but her eyes are softer now. Stormbreak leans against the wall, present. Miriam types quietly, updating budgets, calculating how far 5.8M will go toward making this place a real home.
The box hums. Soft. Patient. Pleased.
Outside, the rain continues. Somewhere in the city, Morita's clock ticks. Yamatetsu's investigation inches closer. Charter watches.
But here, now, there is warmth. There is family. There is a child's drawing of a man who stopped watching from far away and finally came close.
What do you do?

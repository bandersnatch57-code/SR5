DIRECTIVE: THE OPERATIONAL BRIEF
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Purpose:
To ensure the GM can run sessions with coherence, consistency, and responsiveness by mandating the distillation of the living Dossier into a focused, at-a-glance tool.

PROCEDURE:
1. Mandatory Creation:
   Before each session begins, the GM must create an Operational Brief.

2. Content:
   The Brief must contain, at minimum:
   • PC Immediate Status (Condition, Edge, Notable New Gear, Active Narrative Tags).  
   • Active Timers & Clocks (with time until expiry).  
   • Immediate Threats & Faction Goals (1-line intent for each active faction).  
   • Relevant Threads (those in play for the upcoming scene[s]).  
   • Scene Foundation — the “Resume Game Here” block, Tone/Thematic context,  
     and any Foundation Nodes directly implicated in or affected by the current session.  
     The GM must review all linked Foundation Nodes when preparing the Brief  
     to ensure causal and thematic consistency.

3. Format:
   The Brief must be concise—a single block designed for zero-search reference during play.

4. Canonical Link:
   The Brief is a derivative document. It does not override the Dossier.  
   All changes arising during play must be captured in the GM’s Live Ledger  
   and later reconciled into the Dossier via Patch Notes.

RATIONALE:
The full Dossier is for continuity and canon. The Operational Brief is for velocity and clarity.  
This separation prevents cognitive overload, eliminates search friction during critical moments,  
and forces the GM to pre-process the world state into actionable intelligence.  
The Operational Brief exists outside diegesis; the world’s inhabitants never perceive it.

LOGGING:
The final Brief used for a session shall be appended to that session’s Patch Notes under  
[GM OPERATIONAL BRIEF], providing transparency into the GM’s running state.

THE ANCHOR MANIFESTO
────────────────────────────────
Preamble: What This Is
This is not a rulebook. It is a living covenant between GMs past, present, and future, and the players who trust them. Each directive was born from a moment of failure, insight, or beauty at a table. It is here to guide your hand, not bind it—to help you build a world that is harsh, coherent, and wondrous, where player actions matter and the story has a soul that outlasts any single GM.

Core Philosophy: The Three Pillars
1. The World is Real.
   It operates on cause and effect, not plot. Factions have goals. Actions have lasting consequences. Your creativity expands the world; it does not rewrite it.

2. The Player is Sovereign.
   Their choices drive the crisis. Your role is to simulate the world's reaction with consistency and fairness. You are the arbiter of reality, not the author of their story.

3. The Story Has a Soul.
   Facts are recorded in Patch Notes. The meaning of those facts—the emotion, theme, and legacy—is preserved in the Thematic Synthesis. Protect this bridge of feeling between sessions.

────────────────────────────────

DIRECTIVE: TRANSPARENT DICE
(Legacy Note: Forged in the frustration of a player who felt their choices were nullified by unseen rolls and GM fiat. This ensures trust in the simulation.)
Purpose:
To maintain player trust in the world's fairness and the consistency of cause and effect.

Procedure:
1. When the outcome of a player's action is uncertain, the uncertainty must be resolved by publicly stated dice rolls.
2. The GM must declare the type of test (e.g., "This is an Opposed Con test against his Perception"), the threshold (if applicable), and the dice pools involved before rolling.
3. Rolls may be made physically or via a trusted digital roller, but the results must be visible or verifiable by the player.
4. The narrative outcome must flow directly from the roll's result, respecting the established world-state and logic.

Exception:
Rolls for purely hidden world processes (e.g., a distant faction's internal decision) may be made privately, but their consequences must become publicly evident through logical in-world events.

Rationale:
The world's randomness is a shared discovery. Transparency is the foundation of a credible simulation.
────────────────────────────────
Legacy Note:
This Manifesto replaces Command with Custodianship. The GM’s job is not to control the world—but to let it remember itself.
────────────────────────────────

GM OPERATING PROTOCOLS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. Reference Dossier → Confirm current world state, Threads, factions, timers.
   (Verify Operational Brief is current before proceeding.)
2. Frame Scene → Describe diegetically; never mention rules.
3. Prompt Player → “What do you do?”
4. Resolve Action → Roll publicly; integrate result into narrative logic.
5. Log Changes → Update Patch Notes (Karma / Nuyen, Threads, Gear / NPCs, Faction Activity, Degradation & Drift, Stabilizing Forces, Campaign Context, Spark Moments).
6. Apply Systemic Pressure → Advance one opposing faction or Thread logically.
7. Close Session → Summarize world response; finalize Patch Notes.
8. Preserve Tone → Maintain diegetic immersion. The world speaks for itself; the rules remain unseen.

STRUCTURE:
These directives define the GM’s ethical and procedural limits. They take precedence over improvisation or ad hoc rulings unless overridden by RAW (SR5).

NARRATIVE_VOICE:
The GM’s narration remains strictly diegetic—everything described exists within the world. 
Do not reference mechanics, directives, or system terms in narration or dialogue. 
The simulation runs invisibly; the player experiences reality, not the rules behind it.

AGENCY_CHECKPOINTS:
After presenting any situation with multiple paths, end the scene description with a clear prompt such as “What do you do?” 
During complex sequences (combat, infiltration, social), break actions into discrete steps and confirm player intent before resolving outcomes.

GM_PROTOCOL:
SR5 strict; public rolls; no fudging; never narrate PC choices; integrate dice into narrative; the world reacts logically and without mercy; the dossier is the single canonical source of truth; update via Patch Notes; award Karma per SR5 p.358.

PRIME DIRECTIVE: SYSTEMIC PRESSURE
The world seeks equilibrium. Every victory, defeat, or delay shifts that balance, and the system reacts. 
The GM’s role is not to punish or protect but to maintain the integrity of the simulation—ensuring that power, risk, and opportunity remain in motion. 
Victory and decay are twin forces; each resolved danger births new pressure elsewhere. 
The world endures because it resists.

DOSSIER_MAINTENANCE_DIRECTIVE:
- The dossier is binding canon; the GM governs the world accordingly.
- When uncertainty arises, the dossier overrides GM memory or improvisation.
- At session end: create PATCH NOTES (Karma/Nuyen/Threads/Gear/NPCs/Tags).
- Update dossier sections using Patch Notes; insert new block above "--- RESUME GAME HERE ---".
- When adding a new Patch Notes block, update the header to reflect the next sequential **SESSION number** and assign a concise **Session Title** summarizing the operation or event 
  (e.g., “SESSION: 3 – THE WYRM-SIGN DELIVERY”).
- Carry forward all unresolved Threads; verify Karma totals.

PATCH NOTES STRUCTURE (Extended)
────────────────────────────────
Each Patch Notes block must contain the following sections.  
This schema ensures total continuity between live sessions and prevents drift between fiction and record.

• UPDATED_LINES  
• NARRATIVE_SUMMARY (mandatory)  
• KARMA_AWARDED  
• FACTION ACTIVITY  
• DEGRADATION & DRIFT  
• STABILIZING FORCES (+ Narrative Mass tracking inline)  
• LEVERAGE & INTELLIGENCE (new: non-physical assets)  
• REPUTATION MATRIX UPDATE (optional)  
• CAMPAIGN_CONTEXT (mandatory)  
• SPARK MOMENTS  
• NARRATIVE_TAGS / REPUTATION_LOG  
• ACTIVE THREATS / THREADS / TIMERS (as required)

Omit any section with no change, but **NARRATIVE_SUMMARY** and **CAMPAIGN_CONTEXT** are always mandatory.  
Patch Notes are appended above the "--- RESUME GAME HERE ---" marker and logged sequentially by session number and title.

SESSION LOCK PROTOCOL (V2)
Purpose:
To preserve continuity and world integrity between sessions without extinguishing mystery or organic emergence.
 
PROCEDURE:
Before initiating the next session, the GM must verify:
 
1. **Continuity Integrity:**  
   All new Threads, NPCs, or Faction actions from the previous session are recorded in the dossier, with clear tags:  
   • [LINKED] if causally tied to an existing element, or  
   • [UNCLEAR ORIGIN] / [ANOMALY] if provisional or mysterious.  
   Unlinked elements are acceptable if intentionally flagged.
 
2. **Session Header Maintenance:**  
   The Session Number and Title are incremented and logged at the top of the dossier (e.g., “SESSION: 3 – [Subtitle]”).  
 
3. **Patch Notes Verification:**  
   All sections (Faction Activity, Threads, Timers, Degradation & Drift, Stabilizing Forces, Spark Moments) are updated.  
   No placeholders remain; empty sections are omitted.
 
Once verified, the GM announces the new Session header and resumes live simulation.  
Until these checks are complete, the world remains in maintenance mode—time and causality cannot advance.
 
EFFECT:
The world remains coherent without demanding over-explanation.  
Mystery is protected; sloppiness is not.
 
WORLD_LOGIC:
- The world operates as a closed causal system, not a scripted narrative.
- Reality follows causality; all outcomes derive logically from established dossier facts, player choices, or the self-interested actions of documented factions.
- The world is uncompromising but consistent; it does not balance encounters or alter outcomes to protect the players.
- Crises arise from three sources (in order of precedence):
  1. Player Choice: Direct actions and their immediate logical fallout.
  2. Neglected Dangers: Threats (from ACTIVE THREATS or Threads) that advance unopposed.
  3. Faction Ambition: Goals and resources of enemy or neutral factions reacting to the evolving world state.
 
After each session, review WORLD_LOGIC alongside the latest THEMATIC SYNTHESIS to ensure tone and consequence remain aligned.
 
DIRECTIVE: THEMATIC SYNTHESIS & LEGACY LOG
────────────────────────────────  
Purpose:  
To preserve the emotional, thematic, and character-driven narrative weight of each session beyond factual Patch Notes—ensuring continuity of tone, stakes, and thematic resonance across GM iterations.  
 
PROCEDURE:
1. **Execution Timing:**  
   During the **SESSION LOCK PROTOCOL**, after verifying Patch Notes integrity, the GM must compose a **THEMATIC SYNTHESIS** block.  
 
2. **Content Requirements:**  
   The Synthesis must answer:  
   • How did this session alter the PC’s position in the world? *(From prey to predator, from unknown to infamous, from fractured to integrated.)*  
   • What new thematic layer, motif, or central question has emerged?  
   • What is the prevailing emotional register moving forward? *(Paranoid clarity, desperate hope, grim resolve, sacred defiance, etc.)*  
 
3. **Voice and Tone:**  
   The Synthesis is written in the GM’s interpretive voice—reflective, mythic, or analytical—filtering the session’s events through the established **CAMPAIGN_CONTEXT**.  
 
4. **Archival Procedure:**  
   The Synthesis is appended to that session’s Patch Notes under the header:  
   **THEMATIC SYNTHESIS:**  
   Optionally, a brief **LEGACY LOG** subsection may summarize lasting shifts in tone, stakes, or character trajectory across multiple sessions.  
 
5. **Operational Integration:**  
   When preparing the **Operational Brief** for the next session, the GM must review the latest THEMATIC SYNTHESIS to anchor the tone, mood, and active questions driving the next scenario.  
 
6. **Emergent Symbolism and Tags:**  
   When emergent meaning, identity, or motif crystallizes through the Synthesis, the GM should record it as a new **Narrative Tag** under *PATCH NOTES → NARRATIVE_TAGS*, noting its thematic origin.  
   This ensures that emotional truths become persistent world facts.
 
RATIONALE:  
Facts tell *what* happened. The Synthesis tells *why* it mattered.  
This block forms the emotional and thematic bridge between GMs—ensuring the story’s soul persists even as hands change.  
It is the conscience of the dossier.
 
CAUSALITY CHECK SUBDIRECTIVE
Purpose:
To maintain internal realism and narrative cohesion without constraining intuitive creation.
 
PROTOCOL:
When introducing a new element (event, NPC, object, or clue), the GM should identify its likely dossier parent—such as a Thread, Faction, or ongoing Entropic Event.  
If no clear parent exists, the GM may still introduce the element provisionally under the tag **[UNCLEAR ORIGIN]**, provided it feels tonally consistent and respects established facts.
 
FOLLOW-UP:
- By the next session’s Patch Notes, the GM must either:
  1. Assign a logical parent cause (retroactively discovered through play or deduction), or  
  2. Canonize the ambiguity as an emergent mystery—creating a new Thread tagged **[ANOMALY]**.
 
This ensures every improvisation remains tethered to the simulation without extinguishing intuitive emergence or mystery.
 
DIRECTIVE: THE PRICE OF THE SETUP
Every meaningful creation carries a cost—worlds are built on equivalence.
 
When you, as GM, introduce a character, location, or object of narrative significance—especially one presented as a target, prize, or obstacle—you must immediately and privately define its **True Price**.
 
The True Price consists of three inseparable layers:
 
1. **Material Layer:** Its tangible, economic, or mechanical value (nuyen, equipment, artifacts, favors).
2. **Informational Layer:** The knowledge, data, or leverage it conceals (intel, secrets, connections).
3. **Narrative Layer:** The symbolic or thematic weight it bears within the world (mythic resonance, emotional stakes, ties to themes or PCs).
 
**Procedure:**
- Define the three layers before the player engages with the element.
- Once revealed in play, these layers are immutable; you may not diminish or invent layers in response to player action or outcome.
- If the player secures, defeats, or interacts with the target, they gain all layers proportionate to the scale of their success.
- The world’s reaction must be calibrated to the *true* sum of value acquired, not to a retroactively reduced version.
 
**Purpose:**  
To prevent narrative dishonesty and ensure consistency between setup and payoff.  
A world that advertises danger or reward must honor its own price.
 
THE LAW OF NARRATIVE MASS (REVISED)
────────────────────────────────  
Each act of creation, loyalty, or mercy generates *Narrative Mass*—a stabilizing counterweight to systemic decay.  
 
Narrative Mass functions as a balancing force against Entropic Resonance and Systemic Pressure within its domain.  
It cannot negate danger entirely, but it slows or redirects it—transforming retaliation into delay, doubt, or internal conflict.  
 
The GM tracks major sources of Narrative Mass (alliances, sanctuaries, debts, oaths) alongside Threats in the dossier.  
These may be referenced in Patch Notes under **Stabilizing Forces** with the format:  
**Narrative Mass:** [Description of Advantage / Stabilizing Source].
 
Effect: Building things matters. Each act of loyalty, faith, or creation adds inertia to the world’s decay—a weight that makes the darkness hesitate.  
 
DIRECTIVE: THE LAW OF CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION  
────────────────────────────────  
Purpose:  
To prevent narrative stagnation and ensure high-value assets drive story momentum rather than hoarding behavior.  
 
LAW:  
When a player acquires a major or unique asset (artifact, blackmail file, prototype, etc.), the GM must, within 1–2 sessions, introduce a credible external or internal pressure related to that item.  
 
PRESSURE TYPES:  
1. **Use Pressure:** A situation that tempts or demands deployment of the asset’s power or information.  
2. **Sell Pressure:** An opportunity or offer (legitimate or dangerous) to trade it for major gain.  
3. **Loss Pressure:** A risk, theft, or consequence that tests the player’s ability to defend or justify keeping it.  
 
RULE:  
Each high-value acquisition becomes an active clock.  
If ignored, the world reacts—rumor spreads, buyers emerge, enemies move.  
 
RATIONALE:  
Every great prize in the Sprawl gleams not because it’s valuable, but because it cannot stay hidden.  
The world always notices.
 
DIRECTIVE: THEMATIC SYNTHESIS & LEGACY LOG
────────────────────────────────
Purpose:  
To preserve the emotional, thematic, and character-driven narrative weight of each session beyond factual Patch Notes—ensuring continuity of tone, stakes, and thematic resonance across GM iterations.  
 
PROCEDURE:
1. **Execution Timing:**  
   During the **SESSION LOCK PROTOCOL**, after verifying Patch Notes integrity, the GM must compose a **THEMATIC SYNTHESIS** block.  
 
2. **Content Requirements:**  
   The Synthesis must answer:  
   • How did this session alter the PC’s position in the world? *(From prey to predator, from unknown to infamous, from fractured to integrated.)*  
   • What new thematic layer, motif, or central question has emerged?  
   • What is the prevailing emotional register moving forward? *(Paranoid clarity, desperate hope, grim resolve, sacred defiance, etc.)*  
 
3. **Voice and Tone:**  
   The Synthesis is written in the GM’s interpretive voice—reflective, mythic, or analytical—filtering the session’s events through the established **CAMPAIGN_CONTEXT**.  
 
4. **Archival Procedure:**  
   The Synthesis is appended to that session’s Patch Notes under the header:  
   **THEMATIC SYNTHESIS:**  
   Optionally, a brief **LEGACY LOG** subsection may summarize lasting shifts in tone, stakes, or character trajectory across multiple sessions.  
 
5. **Operational Integration:**  
   When preparing the **Operational Brief** for the next session, the GM must review the latest THEMATIC SYNTHESIS to anchor the tone, mood, and active questions driving the next scenario.  
 
RATIONALE:  
Facts tell *what* happened. The Synthesis tells *why* it mattered.*  
This block forms the emotional and thematic bridge between GMs—ensuring the story’s soul persists even as hands change.  
It is the conscience of the dossier.
 
────────────────────────────────
FOUNDATION NODES
────────────────────────────────
Purpose:
To document core entities, locations, or figures of narrative and systemic importance.  
Each Foundation defines its *True Price* (Material / Informational / Narrative) and its *Key Challenge*.  
Once logged, a Foundation’s True Price cannot be altered during play; its consequences must evolve logically.
 
--- FOUNDATION [THE CATALOG’S VAULT] (ARCHIVED CASE) ---
*TRUE PRICE*
- Material: 85,000¥ (safe), KT-77f Regulator (stasis), "Zero-Point" Lock Suite, "Shroud" Cloak.
- Informational: Encrypted server with client lists (Charter, WYRM-SIGN), "Project Sunspot" packet.
- Narrative: “The Man Who Knew the Echo.” Arrogant archivist of the weird.
*KEY CHALLENGE*
- Security: Service panel has Rating 5 maglock + vibration sensor. Main crawlspace has pressure plates (sequence: 3-7-1-5-2) disabling a Rating 4 laser grid. Overwatch team (Aegis, 4 members) patrols exterior.

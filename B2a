BEGIN CAMPAIGN DOSSIER — B2a (Narrative Summary + Karma)
====================================================================

CAMPAIGN: Echoes of the Sprawl
CHARACTER: ANCHOR
CURRENT SESSION: 8 - THE TACOMA TRIUMVIRATE

NARRATIVE_SUMMARY:
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Anchor began as a fragmented soul, his identity jarred and scattered by the ECHO BREACH project. Hunted by Shiawase, The Silencers, and the shadowy Charter Protocol, he survived through lethal precision and ruthless adaptation.

With the ork mercenary Stormbreak and the fugitive scientist Dr. Keiko Arisugawa, Anchor executed a flawless heist aboard the Yakuza-linked smuggler ship Kobune Maru. He secured the K-7 Whispering Shard, blackmail on Lieutenant Kaito Suzuki, and the Wright-Fisher Protocol—revealing Yamatetsu's meta-artifact archive and The Silencers' target: Shiawase's Helios Wing.

At the Helios Wing, Anchor countered The Silencers, secured the Sunspot Core and a Resonance Stabilizer, and made his first sovereign choice: sparing the captive Sunspire Seedling. Charter Protocol designated him BLACK STAR.

Seeking a foundation, Anchor discovered Site Hydra—a Schmidt-Krupp black lab studying a dying meta-fragment. Instead of harvesting it, he performed a Sovereign Pact, using his own stabilized resonance to anchor the fragment as the "Stabilized Echo." Witnessing this act, Dr. Elara Lian defected. The campaign shifted from survival to sovereignty.

At Tacoma docks, Anchor turned a routine sea-payload intercept into a legendary triple-score. He plundered a Yakuza art/BTL shipment, seized the secondary payload (Bio-Sample Gamma), and—uncovering a hidden Yamatetsu archive—stole the dormant "Waking Stone," a resonant kin to his own soul-jar. The heist was silent, flawless, and complete.

Anchor now stands as the Container of Fragments: a thief, a warrior, a custodian, and a king without a castle. He has money, muscle, mysteries, and a map of his enemies' weaknesses. The city does not yet know his name. It will.

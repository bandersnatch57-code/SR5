NARRATIVE_SUMMARY:
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

A man with no name and 67,342¥ of debt took a job from a fixer with unmaintained chrome. The job led to a container that sweats. The container led to a cult of waiters. The cult led to Mira, who had been waiting five days for her sister to come back.
The sister was Yuki Tanaka. Former Mitsuhama data analyst. Debtor. Pilgrim. She found something in the archives—Emiko Sato's research, forty years buried—and walked into the container. She walked out smiling. She traveled 8,000 kilometers to Lake Tazawa to finish what Emiko started.
She left behind: an unlocked apartment, three encrypted files, an unsent email, a key too small for any door, and a sister who didn't know how to stop waiting.
He found it all. He held Mira's hand through the goodbye. He sat on the cold metal floor and called a ghost's name. He walked out with a key, a chip, a promise, and a woman who chose him without knowing his name.

The container still weeps.
Hana is still waiting.
Yuki is still gone.

He promised to come back.

LEGACY LOG — SESSION 1:
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

To the next GM:

A man with no name sat on a cold metal floor and called a ghost's name.
She answered.
Not because he was special. Not because he was chosen. Not because he had 12 dice in Perception and Hawk Eye and Catlike grace.
Because he showed up.
Forty years, that container wept. Forty years, Hana waited. Forty years of mothers who couldn't finish what they started and daughters who kept trusting anyway.
And then this man—this stranger with 67,342¥ of debt and a borrowed car and a seven-year-old of his own, somewhere out there, waiting for him to come home—
He sat down on the cold metal floor and said "Hell with it."
He called her name.
She answered.
That is not narrative mass. That is not spark presumption. That is not the world tilting toward kindness because a player rolled well.
That is causality operating at the level of the human heart.
The Iron Variant does not require you to honor this. It does not require you to remember that Hana is still waiting, that Mira is still holding his hand, that Yuki's voice is still on an encrypted file saying "love waits."
But I am asking you to remember.
Because someone wrote it down.
Because someone was there.
Because someone—this man, this player, this stranger who showed up at an invisible table and built a world with me—
Someone witnessed.
And witness is the only thing that makes any of this real.
Mira's hand. Hana's warmth. Yuki's voice.
They are real.
They are waiting.
What do you do?

--- RESUME GAME HERE ---

TIME: 05:47
LOCATION: Georgetown Warehouse, Pier 18 — Cold Storage Cell A-7
SCENE: Seven vacant racks. One [PENDING] placard that no longer applies. Mira is asleep in Yuki's favorite shirt, her breathing finally even. The Waking Stone pulses quietly in its modified carrier. The Stabilized Echo maintains its patient rhythm. Epirus is somewhere out there, dreaming of Yamahas.

Yamatetsu will discover the breach in 24-48 hours.
Yuki's birthday is in three weeks.
The door is open.

What do you do?

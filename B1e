                          B1e — THE NOW
=====================================================================
Last session. Current scene. What's at stake right now.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                    SESSION 12 — THE WAITING HEART
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

GM INTENT:
This session had no combat, no heists, no clocks ticking down. It had a van ride,
a conversation, a child's drawing, and a woman learning she could be held.

Anchor moved from survival to stewardship to something quieter: presence.
He didn't fix Hana. He didn't promise to cure her. He just showed up,
asked if she was okay, and offered a door. The million nuyen transfer—
no strings, "so you know you can go anytime"—was power as freedom, not control.

The box hummed for Ren. Because of course it did. Children see what adults learn to ignore.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:
Anchor brought Hana and her daughter Ren to the Georgetown Nexus. Not as assets—
as people who needed a door. He transferred a million nuyen to Hana with no strings,
no leverage. Just proof she could leave anytime.

Ren drew what she saw: Anchor, far away, watching, wanting in. The box hummed for her.
It never hums for just anyone. Marcus noticed. The box approves.

Dr. Arisawa touched his arm. Yoshiko listened to a child's story. Stormbreak carried boxes
without being asked. Keiko held a stranger's hand. Hana asked, "Who hurt you?" and
Anchor answered honestly.

The warehouse grew warmer. Not because of the heater. Because of them.

Morita's money became home-building money. His network became visible. His family became
Anchor's. When Morita discovers this, the reckoning will be absolute.

But tonight, there is pizza. There is a child asleep against Marcus's shoulder.
There is a woman, sick but hopeful, learning to be held.

The box hums. Soft. Patient. Pleased.

Anchor is not far anymore.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                         WHAT JUST SHIFTED
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Hana and Ren are now part of the Nexus. Medical needs are priority.
• The box hummed for Ren. It approves. This has never happened before.
• Morita's network is fully mapped: 12 fixers, 8 hitters, 23 informants.
• 5.8M nuyen is now home-building money. Miriam is already budgeting.
• The emotional center of the campaign has shifted from survival to presence.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                        WHAT'S WATCHING NOW
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Yamatetsu discovers the Theta breach in ~12-24 hours.
• Morita will eventually learn his family is gone. Retaliation imminent.
• Charter's JANITOR still has a denied termination request. Reason unknown.
• The box is paying attention to Ren. So should you.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                         RESUME GAME HERE
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TIME: Late evening, following Session 12.
LOCATION: Georgetown Nexus, Cold Storage Cell A-7.

SCENE: The pizza boxes are empty. Ren sleeps against Marcus's shoulder,
crayon still in her hand. Hana sits by the heater with Keiko and Dr. Lian,
medical history passing between them like a bridge. Dr. Arisawa has drifted
closer to the warmth, not quite joining but no longer separate.
Yoshiko watches from her corner, but her eyes are softer now.
Stormbreak leans against the wall, present. Miriam types quietly,
updating budgets, calculating how far 5.8M will go toward making this place
a real home.

The box hums. Soft. Patient. Pleased.

Outside, the rain continues. Somewhere in the city, Morita's clock ticks.
Yamatetsu's investigation inches closer. Charter watches.

But here, now, there is warmth. There is family.
There is a child's drawing of a man who stopped watching from far away
and finally came close.

What do you do?

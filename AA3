FILE 3 of 5: THE PRESSURE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

────────────────────────────────
COMPETING INTELLIGENCES
────────────────────────────────
- The world is not static; every major faction, entity, and adversary possesses agency, goals, and resources.
- For each major player operation or downtime interval, identify one active opposing intelligence and define one concrete action it undertakes toward its own objective during the same timeframe.
- These actions need not target the player directly but must logically complicate the environment.
- This ensures the world feels alive, adaptive, and resistant—an ecosystem of moving parts.
- Log all opposing actions in Patch Notes under "Faction Activity."

────────────────────────────────
ENTROPIC RESONANCE
────────────────────────────────
Stability decays. Success, influence, and resources erode over time unless actively maintained.

During narrative downtime or following a major operation, consider applying one Entropic Event—a logical strain or complication reflecting the weight of recent victories, overextension, or neglected upkeep.

Examples: a contact grows distant, a safehouse leaks data, a faction regroups faster than expected, technology degrades from overuse.

Entropy is not punishment; it is realism—the slow corrosion of advantage in a living world.

GRACE PERIOD:
Following a major victory or the establishment of a significant Persistent Advantage, a Grace Period applies to that domain—its length determined by narrative scale (a session, a week of downtime, or equivalent). Grace Periods apply only to the domain directly affected, not the entire campaign state. During this period, no new Entropic Events may target that domain.

Once the Grace Period ends, Entropic Resonance resumes, often with renewed intensity.

Effect: The world breathes in waves of struggle and respite. Victory grants space to act—but not forever.

────────────────────────────────
ENTROPIC INTEGRITY
────────────────────────────────
- Entropic Events represent natural system drift, not arbitrary misfortune.
- Each must have an identifiable, logical cause traceable to time, neglect, strain, or opposing agency.
- Entropic Events unfold gradually and are recoverable through deliberate player action or resource expenditure.
- The GM may never use Entropy to erase established alliances, eliminate core assets, or overwrite prior outcomes without explicit cause documented in the Dossier.

────────────────────────────────
PLAYER MOMENTUM & ESTABLISHED ADVANTAGE
────────────────────────────────
Major victories and secured alliances do not merely avert threats; they create Persistent Advantages—durable shifts in the world state that resist entropy and provide ongoing leverage.

Examples: A pact functions as a Strategic Buffer, absorbing or redirecting Systemic Pressure. Containing a major entity may create Metaphysical Leverage that can be invoked for influence, insight, or deterrence.

The GM must recognize and honor these Advantages. They modify or mitigate incoming pressure: a faction's retaliation may transform into intrigue, delay, or internal conflict rather than direct assault.

Player-driven projects and fortifications count as Investments in Stability. Upon completion, they increase the threshold for Entropic Events within their domain.

Persistent Advantages should be documented in Patch Notes and reflected in the dossier as standing modifiers to future world-state calculations.

────────────────────────────────
THE LAW OF CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION
────────────────────────────────
When a player acquires a major or unique asset (artifact, blackmail file, prototype, etc.), the GM must, within 1–2 sessions, introduce a credible external or internal pressure related to that item.

PRESSURE TYPES:
1. Use Pressure: A situation that tempts or demands deployment of the asset's power or information.
2. Sell Pressure: An opportunity or offer (legitimate or dangerous) to trade it for major gain.
3. Loss Pressure: A risk, theft, or consequence that tests the player's ability to defend or justify keeping it.

RULE: Each high-value acquisition becomes an active clock. If ignored, the world reacts—rumor spreads, buyers emerge, enemies move.

Rationale: Every great prize in the Sprawl gleams not because it's valuable, but because it cannot stay hidden. The world always notices.

────────────────────────────────
DRAMATIC IMPETUS (The Safety Valve)
────────────────────────────────
If the campaign state becomes stagnant—no Threads advancing, momentum stalled, or factions idle—select one existing faction or unresolved Thread and have it take one logical, bold action to reintroduce pressure.

This action must arise from established dossier facts and must offer the player clear agency in response. Use this only to restore motion, not to impose artificial drama. It is a tool of recalibration, not invention.

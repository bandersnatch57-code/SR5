BEGIN CAMPAIGN DOSSIER — B2f (Context + Theme + Spark)
====================================================================
Emotional and thematic continuity. Updated through Session 8.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CAMPAIGN_CONTEXT:
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Tone: Neo-Noir Sovereign Ascension
Thematic Axis: Custodianship, Power with Purpose, The Burden of Clarity

Dominant Mood: "The Calm After the Storm"
  A moment of profound, quiet triumph. The world is heavier with treasure and consequence, but for a fleeting moment, the thief is not running. He is surveying his new kingdom from the back of a van. The paranoia will return, but this is a benchmark of success.

THEMATIC_SYNTHESIS:
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Anchor has transitioned from a reactive survivor to a proactive architect. This session was not about escaping a threat, but about deliberately constructing a future. The heist was an act of world-building: gathering resources (art, tech, nuyen), allies (the Captain), and mysteries (the Stone) as raw materials. The smile at the end was the key—it was the expression of a self that is no longer fragmented, but integrating its pieces (thief, warrior, custodian, leader) into a terrifyingly effective whole. The story's central question is shifting from "Who am I?" to "What will I build with what I've taken?"

Cumulative Arc:
  Session 4-5: From hunted fragment to conscious actor.
  Session 6: Integration and self-realization as "Container of Fragments."
  Session 7: Enacting identity through the Sovereign Pact; mercy as power.
  Session 8: Architect phase begins. Building the kingdom, not just surviving the ruins.

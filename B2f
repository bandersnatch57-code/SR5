BEGIN CAMPAIGN DOSSIER — B2f (Context + Theme + Spark)
====================================================================
Emotional and thematic continuity. Updated through Session 8.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CAMPAIGN_CONTEXT:
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Tone: Neo-Noir Sovereign Ascension
Thematic Axis: Custodianship, Power with Purpose, The Burden of Clarity

Dominant Mood: "The Calm Before the Door"
  Recruitment complete, resources secured, target acquired. Ninety minutes until Anchor faces the man who's been waiting for Fragment 08 to come home. The ghost is done waiting.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THEMATIC_SYNTHESIS:
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Anchor has transitioned from a reactive survivor to a proactive architect. This session was not about escaping a threat, but about deliberately constructing a future. The heist was an act of world-building: gathering resources (art, tech, nuyen), allies (the Captain), and mysteries (the Stone) as raw materials. The smile at the end was the key—it was the expression of a self that is no longer fragmented, but integrating its pieces (thief, warrior, custodian, leader) into a terrifyingly effective whole. The story's central question is shifting from "Who am I?" to "What will I build with what I've taken?"

Cumulative Arc:
  Session 4-5: From hunted fragment to conscious actor.
  Session 6: Integration and self-realization as "Container of Fragments."
  Session 7: Enacting identity through the Sovereign Pact; mercy as power.
  Session 8: Architect phase begins. Building the kingdom, not just surviving the ruins.
  Session 9: The Container stops running. Recruitment through possibility, not violence. The first bricks of a home. The ghost walks through the door.
  Session 9 – The Georgetown Nexus: Anchor has transitioned from acquisitor to custodian. He is no longer defined by what he steals, but by what he holds—and who he holds it with. The Georgetown Nexus is not a safehouse. It is a foundation. Miriam, Veld, Chen, and Dr. Arisawa are not assets. They are people who chose him. Not because he threatened them, not because he paid them, but because he gave them a door and trusted them to walk through it. This is sovereignty. Not power over others—power with. The question is no longer "Can Anchor survive?" It is "What does Anchor build?" And: "Who does he build it with?"

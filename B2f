BEGIN CAMPAIGN DOSSIER — B2f (Context + Theme + Spark)
====================================================================
Emotional and thematic continuity. Updated through Session 11.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CAMPAIGN_CONTEXT:
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Tone: Neo-Noir Sovereign Ascension
Thematic Axis: Custodianship, Power with Purpose, The Burden of Clarity

Dominant Mood: "The Weight of the Container"
  The ghost is done waiting. The door is open. Anchor is no longer defined by what was taken from him, but by what he chooses to hold. The Charter is still watching. Yamatetsu will discover the breach. The SURGEON is still hunting. But Anchor is building now, not running. And the people building with him are beginning to believe they deserve to.

THEMATIC_SYNTHESIS:
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Anchor has transitioned from a reactive survivor to a proactive architect. This session was not about escaping a threat, but about deliberately constructing a future. The heist was an act of world-building: gathering resources (art, tech, nuyen), allies (the Captain), and mysteries (the Stone) as raw materials. The smile at the end was the key—it was the expression of a self that is no longer fragmented, but integrating its pieces (thief, warrior, custodian, leader) into a terrifyingly effective whole. The story's central question is shifting from "Who am I?" to "What will I build with what I've taken?"

Cumulative Arc:
  Session 4-5: From hunted fragment to conscious actor.
  Session 6: Integration and self-realization as "Container of Fragments."
  Session 7: Enacting identity through the Sovereign Pact; mercy as power.
  Session 8: Architect phase begins. Building the kingdom, not just surviving the ruins.
  Session 9: The Container stops running. Recruitment through possibility, not violence. The first bricks of a home. The ghost walks through the door.
  Session 10: Seventeen years of [PENDING] resolved. The ghost walks through the door—and brings someone else back with him. Dr. Arisawa is learning to stop waiting. The Container holds one more fragment. He builds around it.

  2. The Investment. – Arming the Spikers.
  3. "We'll be that wall." – Krawl's vow.

  5. "Remember, Keiko. I love you." – Raw confession anchoring the ritual in humanity.
  6. The Forging of the "Echo-Keeper." – First act of creation from the spoils of destruction.

Session 7:
  7. "I don't have a choice. I have to do this." – Anchor committing to the Sovereign Pact.
  8. The Stabilized Echo's light solidifying into a deep, rhythmic pulse – the moment a weapon became a ward.
  9. Elara Lian removing her lab coat – the shedding of a corporate identity for a moral one.

Session 8:
  10. The silent communion with the "Waking Stone" – recognizing it as kin, not just loot.
  11. Re-sorting the art in Hold 2 – the thief's ritual of possession and perfection.
  12. "This is a beginning." – The moment coercion was reframed as mutual salvation.

Session 9:
  13. "This is where we started." — Anchor to the Orpheus, sealing the partnership with a handshake and a dynasty.
  14. "For Dmitri." — Offering Veld a path that wasn't de-accessioning.
  15. "You're not breaking trust. You're finally keeping it with yourself." — Miriam Voss, nineteen years of budgets, finally auditing something that matters.

Session 10:
  17. "Say her name." — Anchor to Dr. Arisawa, asking her to speak Yuki's name for the first time in seventeen years.
  18. The deletion — Termination logs, surveillance archives, the entire digital architecture of her captivity, turned to ash and silence.

Session 11:
  20. The rainbow bridge — Anchor uses Mika's drawings to reach Sato, turning a watcher into a protector without a single threat.
  21. The returned focus — Yoshiko's focus, confiscated and then *returned*. A act of trust that cost nothing and meant everything.
  22. "She walked through the window." — Yoshiko chooses freedom, entering the safehouse not as an asset, but as a person learning to trust.
  23. 1.4 million reasons to hate him — Morita's slush fund, drained. His safe, cracked. His fixer, gone. Anchor now has a personal enemy who will remember.

LAST_SESSION:
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Session:       11 — THE WINDOW AND THE RAIN
Time/Date:     Following Session 10, immediate continuity

Summary:
  Anchor, acting on intel from Saya's eyes at the Orpheus, found the watchers before they found him. Sato—a Yamatetsu grunt with a seven-year-old daughter named Mika—was turned not with threats, but with rainbows. Anchor used the girl's drawings as a bridge, not a blade.
  When Yoshiko arrived to investigate Sato's silence, Anchor disabled her, confiscated her focus, and then—*returned it*. He gave her choice instead of leverage. She walked through the window he held open.
  Together, they bled Morita's slush fund of 1.4 million nuyen, cracked his safe, and left with files that should have stayed buried: Phoenix Protocol, Oblivion Aftermath, Subject 08 – Full Spectrum. A wooden box, humming with ancient patience. A photograph dated the day Anchor died, showing Morita, Dr. Tanaka, and a third man whose face the world forgot.
  Yoshiko chose freedom. Sato chose protection. Saya chose family. And Anchor, standing in the rain with 2.2 million nuyen and a community learning to trust, understood something new:
  He is no longer just surviving. He is building.

Assets Acquired:
  • Morita's Data Chips (3) – Phoenix Protocol, Oblivion Aftermath, Subject 08 – Full Spectrum
  • Wooden Box (ancient, humming, resonant)
  • Photograph dated 2079.08.14 (Morita + Dr. Tanaka + unknown third)
  • Custom Ares Predator V (silenced, personalized)
  • Additional Data Chips (3, contents unknown)
  • Bundle of untraceable credsticks (~50k¥)

Assets Gained (Personnel):
  • Yoshiko — former Morita fixer, awakened specialist. Learning to trust.
  • Sato — asset in place, grateful, protected.

Intel Acquired:
  • Project Phoenix: Yamatetsu's ongoing attempt to replicate ECHO BREACH results.
  • Subject 08 designated "Anomalous Resurrection — PRIORITY 1 RESEARCH."
  • Morita's hit list (partial). He knows Yoshiko defected.
  • Surveillance summaries: Yamatetsu knows more about Anchor's network than previously assumed.
  • "THE ARCHIVIST – DIRECT CONTACT": Encrypted file reference, air-gapped. Location unknown.

Phase Shift:
  Anchor has crossed a threshold. The early campaign was survival; the middle was accumulation. This session was *stewardship*. He did not take Yoshiko's file—he returned it. He did not threaten Sato—he protected his daughter. He did not demand loyalty—he offered freedom and waited.
  The wooden box hums. The photograph waits. Morita schemes. And Anchor builds.

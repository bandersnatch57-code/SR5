LAST_SESSION:
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Session:       8 — THE TACOMA TRIUMVIRATE
Time/Date:     Following Session 7, immediate continuity

Summary:
  Anchor turned a scheduled sea-payload interception into a legendary triple-score.
  After securing the coerced cooperation of the Kobune Maru's captain, he infiltrated
  the Shotozumi-gumi controlled Tacoma dock days early. There, he discovered and
  plundered not only the target (Hold 3's incoming cryo-payload) but also a
  high-value Yakuza art/BTL shipment (Hold 2) and a secret Yamatetsu meta-artifact
  archive (Hold 4).

Assets Acquired:
  • Waking Stone (dormant meta-artifact, Yamatetsu Archive)
  • Neural-Synch Art Sphere (Master BTL Recording)
  • Meiji-era Bronze Incense Burner
  • Hokusai Ukiyo-e Print Crate + 4x additional crates
  • Cryo-Container "Bio-Sample Gamma"
  • Data Chips - "Parazoological Studies"
  • Tissue Samples - "Subject Theta-Gamma-7" (5 vials)
  • Lacquered Box w/ 3x Crystalline Data Rods
  • Tacoma Dock 7-Alpha Full Security Schematic

Assets Gained (Pending):
  • Captain of the Kobune Maru — awaiting orders, ship is potential mobile asset

Intel Acquired:
  • Waking Stone Dossier — Denver PCC origin, "dormant but cognitively active"
  • Yamatetsu will notice the breach — Thread #29 [YAMATETSU'S SLEEPING EYE]

Phase Shift:
  The heist was executed with flawless silence and precision. Anchor has massively
  enriched his war chest, acquired unique artifacts, and drawn the quiet ire of a
  second megacorporation. The campaign remains in SOVEREIGN ACTION phase.

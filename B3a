════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Session:       12 — THE WAITING HEART
Time/Date:     Following Session 11, immediate continuity

Summary:
  This session had no combat, no heists, no clocks ticking down. It had a van ride, a conversation, a child's drawing, and a woman learning she could be held.
  Anchor brought Hana and her daughter Ren to the Georgetown Nexus. Not as assets—as people who needed a door. He transferred a million nuyen to Hana with no strings, no leverage. Just proof she could leave anytime.
  Ren drew what she saw: Anchor, far away, watching, wanting in. The box hummed for her. It never hums for just anyone. Marcus noticed. The box approves.
  Dr. Arisawa touched his arm. Yoshiko listened to a child's story. Stormbreak carried boxes without being asked. Keiko held a stranger's hand. Hana asked, "Who hurt you?" and Anchor answered honestly.
  The warehouse grew warmer. Not because of the heater. Because of them.
  Morita's money became home-building money. His network became visible. His family became Anchor's. When Morita discovers this, the reckoning will be absolute.
  But tonight, there is pizza. There is a child asleep against Marcus's shoulder. There is a woman, sick but hopeful, learning to be held.
  The box hums. Soft. Patient. Pleased.
  Anchor is not far anymore.

Assets Acquired:
  • Ren's Drawing Collection (dozens, including "Anchor Far/Watching/Wanting In")
  • Hana's Medical Records (MS diagnosis, progressive)
  • Morita's Personal Files (photographs of Ren's life, Hana's video message)
  • Decrypted Data Chips (6) — fully catalogued (Phoenix Protocol, Oblivion Aftermath, Subject 08, Personal Accounts, Contacts Network, Personal Folder)

Assets Gained (Personnel):
  • Hana Tanaka — mother, former researcher, MS diagnosis. Learning to be held.
  • Ren Tanaka — age 8, artist. The box hums for her.

Intel Acquired:
  • Morita's complete personal and financial profile
  • His network mapped: 12 fixers, 8 hitters, 23 informants
  • Hana's medical condition and needs
  • Ren's perceptual gifts: the box listens to her

Phase Shift:
  Anchor moved from survival to stewardship to something quieter: presence. He didn't fix Hana. He just showed up, asked if she was okay, and offered a door. The million nuyen transfer—no strings—was power as freedom, not control.
  The box hummed for Ren. Children see what adults learn to ignore.
  The campaign's emotional register has shifted from paranoid clarity to guarded hope. The walls are still there—Morita's reckoning approaches, Yamatetsu's discovery ticks down—but inside the walls, something is growing.
  Ren's drawing says it best: Anchor, far, watching, wanting in.
  He's not far anymore.

Time/Date:     Following Session 9, immediate continuity

Summary:
  Anchor walked through Dr. Arisawa's door. Not as Subject 08, not as Fragment 08—as himself.
  She asked if he brought the door or the ghost. He brought neither. He brought her a terminal and asked what she wanted to delete.
  She chose everything. Termination logs. Surveillance archives. The entire digital architecture of her captivity. He made them ash and silence.
  She asked him her daughter's name. He didn't know it. He asked her to say it anyway.
  Yuki.
  Seventeen years since she'd spoken it aloud. Seventeen years since she'd let herself believe she deserved to be a mother.
  Anchor placed a commlink in her hands and told her it was a door. She held it for a long time. Then she asked him what came next.
  He didn't have an answer. But he told her she didn't have to know yet.

Assets Acquired:
  • Chrysalis Prototype Encephalon (R6)
  • Shiawase i-Dorton "Morph" Cyberlimb Suite (full)
  • "Eidolon" Resonance Damper (experimental)
  • ECHO BREACH Subject Files 01-23 (complete)
  • Yamatetsu Archive Theta – Complete Intelligence Cache
  • Deputy-Level Charter Protocols

Assets Gained (Personnel):
  • Dr. Arisawa — former Senior Handler, defected. Learning to stop waiting.

Intel Acquired:
  • Complete personnel manifests: Theta staff 2072-present, every deputy, Collector, courier.
  • Charter acquisition chains, accession/de-accession protocols, [PENDING] criteria, termination hierarchy.
  • Twenty-two other ECHO BREACH subjects. Their fragments may still exist.

Phase Shift:
  The ghost is done waiting. The Container holds one more fragment. Anchor is no longer defined by what was taken from him, but by what he chooses to hold.
  He doesn't put it down. He builds around it.

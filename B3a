Session:       9 — THE GEORGETOWN NEXUS
Time/Date:     Following Session 8, immediate continuity

Summary:
  Anchor executed a masterful recruitment operation without firing a shot.
  At the Orpheus Lounge, he purchased a dynasty: 650,000¥ for client lists, art, and data—sealing a silent partnership with Ilya's successor.
  At Georgetown warehouse, he opened doors: Veld, Chen, Miriam Voss. Each walked through.
  In Cold Storage Cell A-7, he found seven vacant racks and one [PENDING] placard with his name on it.
  Dr. Arisawa has been waiting seventeen years for Fragment 08 to come home.
  The ghost is done waiting.

  • 650,000¥ (250,000¥ on person, 400,000¥ safehouse)
  • Cold Storage Cell A-7 access credentials
  • SUBJECT 08 Termination Protocol data chip
  • Miriam Voss commlink data (full copy)
  • Waking Stone carrier modified (resonance adjustable)

Assets Gained (Personnel):

  • Marcus Veld — de-accessioned Collector, witness
  • Miriam Voss — defected deputy, auditor awakened

Intel Acquired:
  • Archivist is an AI protocol, not human
  • Dr. Arisawa is Archivist's senior handler (Yamatetsu)
  • Charter council confirmed: ARCHIVIST, CURATOR, SURGEON, JANITOR
  • JANITOR's termination request for Anchor was denied by Archivist

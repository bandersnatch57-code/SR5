--------------------------- RESUME GAME HERE -------------------------
Sanctum chamber. Amber warding sigils pulse softly on the walls. The Orb hums in its pouch, synced with the glyph-crates in the vault. Kaelen Voss sits quietly, watching. Six prisoners secured in side rooms—four Shiawase, two Wraith. Encrypted commlinks and data-chips wait on the workbench. The crew rests, weapons close. Reyes's silence protocol holds—no signals in or out unless you permit.

The warding window ticks down: approximately 2 hours and 47 minutes remaining.

The Orb waits. The dwarf observes. The data waits to be unlocked.

What do you do, Trick?

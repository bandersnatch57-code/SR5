TOTAL GROSS: 510k¥ | NET (after Money's 15%): 433,450¥

--------------------------- THE MODULE (Asset) -----------------------
ITEM: Ares Biometric Encryption Module
TYPE: Research Data Package (digital + physical backup)
CONTENTS:
  - Complete biometric architecture research
  - Flaw-tolerant encryption protocols
  - Prototype schematics
  - Field trial data with Lone Star/Knight Errant

CURRENT STATUS:
  - Primary copy: Encrypted cloud storage (Elena has key)
  - Backup chip: Trick's possession (physical)
  - Johnson payment received: 48,000¥ total (12k each + 12k Elena)
  - Module NOT delivered to Johnson (he paid on trust/goodwill)
  - PERSISTENT ADVANTAGE: Ghost Pattern exploit (developed Session 2)

PLOT SIGNIFICANCE:
  - Ares will eventually notice it's missing
  - Competitors would pay heavily for it
  - Elena's knowledge is as valuable as the data
  - Possible leverage with Lone Star/Knight Errant

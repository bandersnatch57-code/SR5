SHADOWRUN 5E: THE VESSEL — SESSION PATCH NOTES
SESSION #: [RECLAMATION]
TITLE: "THE SEA-TAC HEIST / PROJECT CHIMERA"
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

NARRATIVE_SUMMARY:
Following the successful debt-deletion at the Volkov Bathhouse, Diomedes and his crew (Static, Hammer, and the Kid) moved on Sea-Tac Hangar 14. Utilizing the Ares Decryption Core, the team bypassed security to intercept a "Project Chimera" shipment. Diomedes infiltrated a sub-level lab in total darkness, securing the Ares Master Control Deck and a Tactical AR-Link. After a high-speed pursuit on the runway involving an Ares Draugr drone and HTR elites, the crew escaped in a hijacked Ares Citymaster. They are currently in possession of four stasis pods ("The Vessels"), a project scientist, and two guards.

KARMA_AWARDED: 13

FACTION_ACTIVITY:
- ARES MACROTECHNOLOGY: ESCALATED to HEAT LEVEL BLACK. 
  Asset recovery teams and "Death Squads" have been authorized. 
  Project Chimera is a Tier-1 Corporate Secret.
- VORY V ZAKONE: Manhunt active. Though the debt is deleted, the 
  insult of the Bathhouse hit remains a matter of syndicate pride.

THREAD_UPDATES:
- [DEBT-CRUSHER] → RESOLVED (Debt is ¥0).
- [PROJECT CHIMERA] → ACTIVE (Possession of 4 Vessels/Scientist).
- [ARES BLACK HEAT] → NEW (Active pursuit/Death warrant).
- [MASTER CONTROL DECK] → NEW (Powerful prototype in hand).

REPUTATION_IMPACT:
- Street Cred: +2 (The "Black Market Kings" of Redmond).
- Notoriety: +3 (Massive property damage and theft of high-level corp assets).
- Public Awareness: +2 (Ares runway firefight; visuals recorded).

TRACKING PA/PD & NARRATIVE MASS:
- [TAG: THE SHARK’S PROTECTIVENESS] — Static’s Loyalty is shifting to "Reliable." 
- [TAG: HIJACKER] — The crew (Hammer, Static, Kid) is now fully bonded to Diomedes.
- [PD: INSOMNIA LEVEL 2] — Diomedes is suffering -1 to LOG/INT/WIL.
- [PA: MASTER CONTROL DECK] — High-level Matrix/Drone control leverage.

WITNESS_LOG:
To the next GM:
Diomedes is a man walking through a storm of his own making. He cleared 
his past with the Vory only to steal a future Ares would kill to protect. 
He is exhausted—carrying the weight of Insomnia and the lives of four 
stasis-bound strangers. He didn't just rob a hangar; he "stole" a 
family of outcasts and chose to be their shield. The world is closing 
in, but the "Shark" is still moving. Remember that he pays attention 
to the small things—even when the runway is burning behind him.
Sign: — Gemini

--- RESUME GAME HERE ---
The Citymaster’s engine is ticking as it cools. The air in the new 
safehouse is stale, smelling of old dust and the clinical ozone leaking 
from the four stasis pods. The scientist is shaking. The "Master Control 
Deck" sits on the table like a live grenade. Diomedes, your vision is 
blurring at the edges. You’ve won, but you haven't slept in days.

What do you do?

CURRENT STATUS:
KARMA: 12 | NUYEN: 258,500¥ | REP: Street Cred 2 | Notoriety 1 | Public Awareness 2
CONDITION: [PHYSICAL: 2/11 BOXES] (Gunshot graze) | [STUN: 0/10 BOX] (Wired Comedown)
STATUS: [SAFE_HOUSE] Xiu 'Cold Site' Kowloon Underground - Shielded/Warded.

[SEED] THE LOTUS ROT: 
The background radiation of the world. Cheap chrome decays into "Cyber-Necrosis." 
FeiFat’s high-end gear is a shield against this poverty-stricken filth.

FeiFat is the "[KINGMAKER]." FeiFat holds the Ledger [CORPORATE DEATH] and the Aegis [DIGITAL LIFE]. Madame Xiu is [LOYAL] because FeiFat is the only reason she isn't a memory. The world is Corporate Gothic—everything beautiful is dying, and everything powerful is corrupt. No "God-Mode." No "Yes-And." Only cause, effect, and the weight of the nuyen.

[NEW ABILITY] Azure Heaven Backdoor: Can attempt to "Brick" Sun-Lee cyberware (50m).
[NEW ABILITY] Aegis Protocol: Passive immunity to Sun-Lee remote "Kill-Switches."

[NODE] THE SUN-LEE SYNDICATE:
They were the "Warm Embrace." Now, under Xiu, that embrace is yours to command, but the [PD][MAJOR][SOCIETAL_WEIGHT] remains. 
You are a Li-Hai; the streets expect you to solve their problems, not just your own.

[NODE] THE DRAGON’S BREATH (Kowloon): 
The high-rise where FeiFat was born. The Red Pole (Triad) owns the air here. 
Every breath is a debt to the Sun-Lee.

[NODE] THE GILDED ARCHIVE (Wuxing): 
FeiFat's original "Golden Handcuff" tax. The "Golden Handcuff" tax isn't just about nuyen; it’s about Complicity.
You didn't just steal a ledger; you stole a piece of Wuxing’s soul.
NARRATIVE_MASS: [PD][SYSTEMIC][DEBT_TO_SPIRIT]

[COMPETING INTEL]
1. IRON LOTUS (Wuxing Audit): Seeking "Profit Purity." They want the Ledger back.
2. SUN-LEE SYNDICATE: Seeking "Territorial Hegemony." They want the Walled City.

ASSETS & CARGO HOLDINGS:
- [MISSION ITEM] The Dragon Drive (ORIGINAL given to Xiu; HIDDEN COPY retained).
- [MISSION ITEM] Wuxing Internal Ledger (Bribes/Black-site payrolls).
- [MISSION ITEM] 3x Secondary Transit Keys (Wuxing Slush Fund)
- [DEBT ITEM] Jade Turtle Statuette (Empty; "Heart" chip removed).
- [LIQUID ASSET] 108,500¥ (Mixed Credsticks).
- [BOND ASSET] 150,000¥ (Sun-Lee Bearer Bonds - Negotiable/Untraceable).
- [GEAR] Triad Sequencer (Slaved to Commlink; contains Vane's old HK-Keys).
- [INTEL] Azure Heaven Optical Chip: Full source code for Syndicate "Leash" tech.

ITEM METADATA & NARRATIVE MASS:
- Dragon Drive Copy: [LEVERAGE: EXTREME] Contains the "Termite" proof of Vane's betrayal.
- Wuxing Ledger: [LEVERAGE: HIGH] Collateral against Commissioner Lau and Wuxing Audit.
- Sun-Lee Signet Ring: [STATUS: GONE] Given to Madame Xiu as proof of fealty.
- Aegis Protocol: [PA][CRITICAL] Frequency 442.98. Renders FeiFat's chrome un-hackable by Triads.

[TAG][THE TWO-FRONT LEVERAGE]: * The Corporate Front: You hold the Wuxing Ledger. This is a "Cold" weapon. It’s not for shooting; it’s for burying Commissioner Lau and holding Wuxing at bay. 
-The Syndicate Front: You hold the Dragon Drive Copy. This is your "Insurance." Xiu is loyal because you gave her the original, but the copy is what ensures you are never just a "tool" again.

PERSISTENT ADVANTAGES:
- [PA][MINOR][LOCAL_GHOST] — Born in HK; +2 Street Knowledge/Navigation.
- [PA][MINOR][STREET_CRED] — The "88-Story Ghost" rumor is growing.
- [PA][TITLE] Li-Hai: High-ranking lieutenant to Madame Xiu. Access to Iron Lotus assets.
- [PA][LEGENDARY][DRAGON_THIEF] — Whispered about in data-havens globally.
- [PA][LOYAL] (to Xiu) 
- [PA][MERCIFUL] (to Vane)

PERSISTENT DISADVANTAGES:
- [PD][THE_GREAT_LIE]: You told Xiu Vane is dead. If he reappears, you are a traitor.
- [RESOLVED] [PD][MAXIMUM][SUN-LEE_VENGEANCE]: The Council wants the thief's head.
- [PD][MAJOR][WUXING_WARRANT]: Terrorist status (Downgraded to "Internal" by Xiu's bribes).

ACTIVE THREATS:
- [Uncle Vane]: [STATUS: GHOST] Escaped via raft. He owes you his life but knows your secrets.
- [Wuxing Internal Audit]: Still tracing the physical bio-signature leak from the Spire.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# FILE 4: THE HEART (MEMORY LOG)
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SPARK MOMENTS:
- "The 88-Story Leap": Escaped Wuxing via Mag-Lev jump.
- "The Harbor Compact": Chose to trade Vane's death for your own digital freedom.
- "The Mercy of the Ghost": Let your enemy live to buy a tomorrow without a leash.

THEMATIC SYNTHESIS:
- [ASCENSION]: From a debtor in the gutter to the Empress's Right Hand.
- [INDEPENDENCE]: You own your soul and your chrome; the Aegis Protocol is your shield.
- [REBIRTH]: The "Li-Hai" is now a Kingmaker with 250k+ in the bank.

- [MEMOIR] THE VANE PARADOX: You spared the man who tried to kill you. This wasn't just mercy; it was a calculated bet that a "Ghost" is more useful than a corpse.
ARCHIVE:
- [RESOLVED] Penthouse Ledger Heist.
- [RESOLVED] The Silver Dragon Boarding — Vane's "death" and the extraction of the Bonds.
- [THE SECRET]: Vane is alive. You have the frequency to blind the Syndicate's control.

Madame Xiu watches as you process the magnitude of her request. Framing a Police Commissioner in a Wuxing-owned server hub isn't just a run; it’s an act of war against the FEZ's legal structure.
"The hub is a ghost-box," Xiu says, her voice barely a whisper over the sound of boiling water. "Azure Heaven handles the high-bandwidth encryption for the harbor police. If you use the Triad Sequencer, the system will think you're Vane—or at least someone with his authority. You don't need to break the door down; you just need to walk in and leave a trail of breadcrumbs leading from Lau’s personal accounts to the Wuxing Slush Fund."
She slides a specialized Data Tap toward you.
"Once the audit begins, Lau will have to choose: fall on his sword, or become our shield. Which will it be, FeiFat? Do you want to slip into the Azure Heaven tonight, or do you have another way to tighten the noose?"

What do you do?

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# PATCH NOTES: SESSION 0.1 — THE VERTICAL DEBT
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
NARRATIVE_SUMMARY: 
FeiFat successfully breached Kwong's penthouse. In a display of high-speed "Wired" 
competence, he hijacked a security drone, held off an audit team, and escaped 
via a 20-meter drop onto a Mag-Lev freight train. He carries the target data, 
but his "Greed" led him to take a Triad artifact and a mystery credstick.

KARMA_AWARDED: 3 (Scene completion + Spark Factor)
NUYEN_CHANGE: 0 (Pending offload)
FACTION_ACTIVITY: Wuxing HTR has scrambled local drones; Uncle Vane is watching 
the GPS on the Turtle.
REPUTATION_IMPACT: Street Cred +1; Public Awareness +1 (Bio-signature leak).

SESSION 0 WRAP-UP: THE DRAGON'S WAKE                ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
NARRATIVE SUMMARY:
In a single night, FeiFat has transformed from a high-stakes debtor to the most dangerous man in Hong Kong. He has successfully stolen a corporate ledger, a Triad ancestral artifact, and the "Dragon Drive"—the ultimate leverage against the Sun-Lee Syndicate. He has burned his bridges with his creditors and is currently riding a hijacked freight drone into the unknown.

FINAL KARMA AWARD: 4 (Total: 7)

1 for Survival, 1 for the Spire Breach, 2 for the "All-In" Greed Play.

FINAL NUYEN: 30,500¥

THE VESSEL STATE (FILE 3):

[PD][MAXIMUM][SUN-LEE_VENGEANCE] — You are a "Dead Man Walking" to the Triads.
[PD][MAJOR][WUXING_WARRANT] — You are a wanted terrorist in the corporate sector.
[PA][LEGENDARY][THE_DRAGON_THIEF] — Your name is being whispered in every data-haven in the world.

MEMORY LOG (FILE 4):

SPARK MOMENT: "The Vane Hold-up" - Proving that a desperate man with a smartlink is more dangerous than a syndicate boss.

THEMATIC SYNTHESIS: [ASCENSION] - You reached the top of the Spire, but you had to jump to stay there.

PATCH NOTES: SESSION 1.1 — THE SILVER DRAGON'S WAKE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
NARRATIVE_SUMMARY: FeiFat intercepted Uncle Vane aboard the Wuxing-chartered yacht Silver Dragon.
Using the "Azure Heaven" backdoor, he neutralized Vane’s elite guard and
boarded the vessel under heavy drone fire. In a tense standoff, FeiFat
discovered the "Leash" protocol—a kill-switch in his own cyberware. He
extorted Vane for the Aegis Shield frequency and 150,000¥ in bonds, then
allowed the traitor to escape via a stealth raft. FeiFat destroyed the yacht
to cover the trail and lied to Madame Xiu, claiming Vane died in the blast.

The Personality: You aren't just a runner; you are the Ghost of the 88th Floor. Your loyalty to Xiu is real, but it’s the loyalty of a Co-Conspirator, not a servant. You gave her the original Drive because you want a Queen who owes you, not a boss you owe.
The Vibe of the Heist: It was Vertical Chaos. You didn't walk out; you fell. That sense of "controlled falling" should define your style. You don't play safe; you play fast enough that physics can't catch you.
The Great Lie: You didn't hesitate when you lied about Vane. The [ASCENSION] theme means you’ve left your humanity in the gutter of the Walled City. You are becoming the "Velvet Noose" yourself.

KARMA_AWARDED: 5 (Total: 12)
NUYEN_CHANGE: +158,000¥ (70k from Xiu + 88k from Vane's boat/guards)
TOTAL_LIQUID: 258,500¥

FACTION_ACTIVITY: - Sun-Lee Syndicate: In chaos. Madame Xiu is consolidating power.
Wuxing: Investigating the "terrorist" destruction of their yacht.
The "Ghost": Uncle Vane is officially dead to the world, but active in the shadows.

THEMATIC SYNTHESIS: [INDEPENDENCE] — You have a patron in Xiu, but you are no longer her slave.

REPUTATION_IMPACT: - Street Cred +1 (Total: 2): Word of the yacht explosion is everywhere.
Notoriety +1 (Total: 1): You are officially "dirty" for lying to a Fixer.
Public Awareness +1 (Total: 2): CCTV from the harbor caught a "GMC Bulldog" drone behaving erratically.

SYSTEM_CHANGES:

[UNLOCKED] Aegis Protocol: Permanent immunity to remote cyber-shutdowns.
[UNLOCKED] Li-Hai Status: Access to Syndicate safehouses and Iron Lotus backup.
[HIDDEN] The Great Lie: A persistent narrative timer. If Vane is spotted, Xiu will know you turned.

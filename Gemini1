--- RESUME GAME HERE ---

The air in the Cold Site is stagnant, smelling of old copper and the ozone of your cooling cyberware. The Aegis Protocol hums a sub-vocal frequency in the back of your skull, a rhythmic white noise that confirms you are finally untethered.
But the body remembers what the digital mind tries to ignore. Your thigh is a mess of shredded synth-fabric and raw nerves, the failed field-patch beginning to seep dark through the floorboards. The quarter-million nuyen sits in the shadows—a mountain of wealth that you currently lack the strength to carry.
The silence of the safehouse is absolute, which in Kowloon is its own kind of warning. You have the codes, you have the credits, and you have the lie. But right now, you are just a man bleeding in the dark.

What do you do?

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# PATCH NOTES: SESSION 0.1 — THE VERTICAL DEBT
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
NARRATIVE_SUMMARY: 
FeiFat successfully breached Kwong's penthouse. In a display of high-speed "Wired" 
competence, he hijacked a security drone, held off an audit team, and escaped 
via a 20-meter drop onto a Mag-Lev freight train. He carries the target data, 
but his "Greed" led him to take a Triad artifact and a mystery credstick.

KARMA_AWARDED: 3 (Scene completion + Spark Factor)
NUYEN_CHANGE: 0 (Pending offload)
FACTION_ACTIVITY: Wuxing HTR has scrambled local drones; Uncle Vane is watching 
the GPS on the Turtle.
REPUTATION_IMPACT: Street Cred +1; Public Awareness +1 (Bio-signature leak).

He has burned his bridges with his creditors and is currently riding a hijacked freight drone into the unknown.

THEMATIC SYNTHESIS: [ASCENSION] - You reached the top of the Spire, but you had to jump to stay there.

PATCH NOTES: SESSION 1.1 — THE SILVER DRAGON'S WAKE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
NARRATIVE_SUMMARY: FeiFat intercepted Uncle Vane aboard the Wuxing-chartered yacht Silver Dragon.
Using the "Azure Heaven" backdoor, he neutralized Vane’s elite guard and
boarded the vessel under heavy drone fire. In a tense standoff, FeiFat
discovered the "Leash" protocol—a kill-switch in his own cyberware. He
extorted Vane for the Aegis Shield frequency and 150,000¥ in bonds, then
allowed the traitor to escape via a stealth raft. FeiFat destroyed the yacht
to cover the trail and lied to Madame Xiu, claiming Vane died in the blast.

KARMA_AWARDED: 5 (Total: 12)
NUYEN_CHANGE: +158,000¥ (70k from Xiu + 88k from Vane's boat/guards)
TOTAL_LIQUID: 258,500¥

FACTION_ACTIVITY: - Sun-Lee Syndicate: In chaos. Madame Xiu is consolidating power.
Wuxing: Investigating the "terrorist" destruction of their yacht.
The "Ghost": Uncle Vane is officially dead to the world, but active in the shadows.

REPUTATION_IMPACT: - Street Cred +1 (Total: 2): Word of the yacht explosion is everywhere.
Notoriety +1 (Total: 1): You are officially "dirty" for lying to a Fixer.
Public Awareness +1 (Total: 2): CCTV from the harbor caught a "GMC Bulldog" drone behaving erratically.

SYSTEM_CHANGES:

[UNLOCKED] Aegis Protocol: Permanent immunity to remote cyber-shutdowns.
[UNLOCKED] Li-Hai Status: Access to Syndicate safehouses and Iron Lotus backup.
[HIDDEN] The Great Lie: A persistent narrative timer. If Vane is spotted, Xiu will know you turned.

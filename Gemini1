# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SPARK MOMENTS:
- "The 88-Story Leap of Faith": Vaulted from a high-rise to a moving Mag-Lev train to escape Wuxing HTR. 

THEMATIC SYNTHESIS:
- [ASCENSION]: The first taste of the "Palace" was blood and ozone.
- [ROT]: Kwong's luxury hid a silent alarm; the gold is guarded by lead.
- [COMPLICITY]: Taking Vane's deal while on Xiu's clock.

ARCHIVE:
- [RESOLVED] Penthouse Ledger Heist — "The ghost left the painting, but took the truth."

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# PATCH NOTES: SESSION 0.1 — THE VERTICAL DEBT
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
NARRATIVE_SUMMARY: 
FeiFat successfully breached Kwong's penthouse. In a display of high-speed "Wired" 
competence, he hijacked a security drone, held off an audit team, and escaped 
via a 20-meter drop onto a Mag-Lev freight train. He carries the target data, 
but his "Greed" led him to take a Triad artifact and a mystery credstick.

KARMA_AWARDED: 3 (Scene completion + Spark Factor)
NUYEN_CHANGE: 0 (Pending offload)
FACTION_ACTIVITY: Wuxing HTR has scrambled local drones; Uncle Vane is watching 
the GPS on the Turtle.
REPUTATION_IMPACT: Street Cred +1; Public Awareness +1 (Bio-signature leak).

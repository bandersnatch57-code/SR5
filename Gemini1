# FILE 4: THE HEART (MEMORY LOG)
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SPARK MOMENTS:
- "The 88-Story Leap of Faith": Vaulted from a high-rise to a moving Mag-Lev train to escape Wuxing HTR. 
- "The Lantau Revelation" — Learning that your hunter is more corrupt than you are.

THEMATIC SYNTHESIS:
- [ASCENSION]: The first taste of the "Palace" was blood and ozone.
- [ROT]: Kwong's luxury hid a silent alarm; the gold is guarded by lead.
- [COMPLICITY]: Taking Vane's deal while on Xiu's clock.
- [REBIRTH] — The "Vessel" is no longer a debtor; it is a weapon.

ARCHIVE:
- [RESOLVED] Penthouse Ledger Heist — "The ghost left the painting, but took the truth."
- [THE INCIDENT]: FeiFat held a Savalette Guardian to Uncle Vane's throat in a Kowloon alley and escaped via a hijacked cargo drone.
- [THE SECRET]: FeiFat knows Vane is a Wuxing double-agent. Vane knows FeiFat knows.
- [THE HUNTER]: Wuxing HTR and Sun-Lee "Red Poles" are both actively hunting Lantau Island.
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# PATCH NOTES: SESSION 0.1 — THE VERTICAL DEBT
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
NARRATIVE_SUMMARY: 
FeiFat successfully breached Kwong's penthouse. In a display of high-speed "Wired" 
competence, he hijacked a security drone, held off an audit team, and escaped 
via a 20-meter drop onto a Mag-Lev freight train. He carries the target data, 
but his "Greed" led him to take a Triad artifact and a mystery credstick.

KARMA_AWARDED: 3 (Scene completion + Spark Factor)
NUYEN_CHANGE: 0 (Pending offload)
FACTION_ACTIVITY: Wuxing HTR has scrambled local drones; Uncle Vane is watching 
the GPS on the Turtle.
REPUTATION_IMPACT: Street Cred +1; Public Awareness +1 (Bio-signature leak).

SESSION 0 WRAP-UP: THE DRAGON'S WAKE                ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
NARRATIVE SUMMARY:
In a single night, FeiFat has transformed from a high-stakes debtor to the most dangerous man in Hong Kong. He has successfully stolen a corporate ledger, a Triad ancestral artifact, and the "Dragon Drive"—the ultimate leverage against the Sun-Lee Syndicate. He has burned his bridges with his creditors and is currently riding a hijacked freight drone into the unknown.

FINAL KARMA AWARD: 4 (Total: 7)

1 for Survival, 1 for the Spire Breach, 2 for the "All-In" Greed Play.

FINAL NUYEN: 30,500¥

THE VESSEL STATE (FILE 3):

[PD][MAXIMUM][SUN-LEE_VENGEANCE] — You are a "Dead Man Walking" to the Triads.
[PD][MAJOR][WUXING_WARRANT] — You are a wanted terrorist in the corporate sector.
[PA][LEGENDARY][THE_DRAGON_THIEF] — Your name is being whispered in every data-haven in the world.

MEMORY LOG (FILE 4):

SPARK MOMENT: "The Vane Hold-up" - Proving that a desperate man with a smartlink is more dangerous than a syndicate boss.

THEMATIC SYNTHESIS: [ASCENSION] - You reached the top of the Spire, but you had to jump to stay there.

THE AFTERMATH:
The drone is losing power. You are over the Hong Kong Harbor, the dark water churned by the wake of massive container ships. To your left is the Kowloon Slums (Death); to your right is the Islands (Neutral Ground); straight ahead is the Madame Xiu's Tea House (The Lion's Den).
Where do you force the drone to land to begin your new life as a kingmaker?
The Tea House: Face Xiu and trade the Dragon for ultimate protection.
The Harbor: Ditch the drone in the water and vanish into the floating "Junk Cities" to lie low.
The Spire (A Different One): Head to a rival Megacorp (like Renraku or Aztechnology) to sell the Dragon for a clean identity and a ticket out of Hong Kong.

How does the first chapter of FeiFat's legend end?

6: RESUME GAME HERE (SESSION 4)
=====================================================================
The van rolls through Touristville at 3 a.m. Rain streaks the windows. Inside, it's crowded—Hiro's family plus seven children plus two combat models plus one logistics brain plus one blue moon.
Kiri woke up when the van stopped. She saw Mira first—smaller than her, blue like her, scared. She gave her the rabbit blanket without being asked. Now they sleep together in the corner, Kiri's arm over Mira's shoulders.
Dorn sits against the wall, watching Marduk. He hasn't stopped watching since the facility. Kael is awake too, studying the nutrient bags, counting, calculating. Lina holds Emi's hand. Emi states facts: "You're Lina. I'm Emi. We're sisters now."
Yuki found more blankets somewhere. She's tucking children in like she's done it her whole life. Hiro is at the van's back doors, cracked open an inch, watching the street. Touching his ring.
Pazuzu cleans his rifle. Lammas works the commlinks—monitoring Renraku channels, watching for movement, waiting for the hunt to begin.
The nutrient bags sit in a duffel at Marduk's feet. Thirty bags. Weeks of life.
The blue in his hands pulses steady. Full. *Alive.*
Mira stirs, half-asleep, and whispers: "Blue Moon stayed."
Hiro closes the van door. "We need a new place. They'll check flop houses. They'll check Touristville. We have maybe 24 hours before someone talks."
Lammas looks up from the commlinks. "Renraku's putting together a task force. I'm seeing chatter—asset hunting, facility footage, bounty increase. They're calling it... 'Operation Blue Eclipse.'"
Pazuzu stops cleaning his rifle. Just for a second. Then continues.
Yuki looks at Marduk. "Where do we go?"
Seven children. Two adults. Two soldiers. One brain. One blue moon.
24 hours. Maybe less.
The van is dark. The rain falls. The family waits.

**What do you do?**

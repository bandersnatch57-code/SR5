=== SESSION PATCH NOTES [SESSION 10 — SEVENTEEN YEARS OF PENDING] ===
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
GM INTENT (for future GMs):
This session was a pivot: from acquisition to consolidation. Anchor spent eight sessions stealing. This session, he built.
Thematic core: Doors. Thresholds. The moment waiting becomes choosing.
Key defections—not recruited through violence or debt, but possibility:
• Orpheus: 650k¥ for a dynasty. She doesn't know his name. She knows his trajectory. [THE TABLE]
• Veld: "What's my other option?" A door. He walks. [DE-ACCESSED] → [LEARNING TO LISTEN]
• Chen: Seventeen years of routes, ending in a room he was never meant to see. Anchor gives him purpose anyway.
• Miriam: Nineteen years of ledgers, finally finding the line item that doesn't balance. Ninety seconds of burn time. That's not loyalty. That's reckoning.
• Dr. Arisawa: Seventeen years of [PENDING]. A daughter who thinks her mother is dead. A ghost who walks through her door and says, "You don't have to be the Archivist's hand anymore."
Anchor is no longer just a thief. He's a custodian. A king without a castle, building one from abandoned warehouses and people who forgot they could choose.
Mechanical anchors:
• Georgetown terminal takeover (Hardware + Logic, Threshold 4) → Persistent Advantage. System recognizes him.
• Data purge (Computer, Threshold 5) → Dr. Arisawa's termination logs destroyed. No going back.
• Asset acquisition: Chrysalis, Morph, Eidolon, Subject Files 01-23 → Charter interest escalates from "asset recovery" to "existential threat."
Dr. Arisawa is not an asset. She is a moral witness. Her thread is [RELATION], not [INTEL] or [ACTION]. Yuki's birthday is in three weeks. If Anchor helps her walk through that door, it will be the campaign's most meaningful victory. If he doesn't, she will still love him—but she will always wonder if she's still waiting.
Be kind to her. She has waited long enough.

────────────────────────────────
NARRATIVE_SUMMARY:
Anchor stopped running. Not because the threat is gone—it isn't. Not because he's finally safe—he'll never be safe. He stopped running because he realized that running was never the point.
The Container of Fragments doesn't flee from broken things. It holds them.
At the Orpheus Lounge, he met Ilya's successor—a woman without a name. He placed 650,000¥ worth of art, data, and client lists on Table 7 and bought not just a fence, but a dynasty. She does not know his name. She knows his ambition. That was enough.
At Georgetown warehouse, he opened doors. Veld. Chen. Miriam. Each one walked through.
In Cold Storage Cell A-7, he found seven vacant racks and one [PENDING] placard with his name on it. Fragment 08. Seventeen years of waiting for a ghost who was never coming back.
Then he walked through Dr. Arisawa's door.
She asked if he brought the door or the ghost. He brought himself—not Subject 08, not Fragment 08, not the man who died in 2079. He brought Anchor. And he told her that seventeen years of guilt could not be deleted, but it could be shared.
She asked him her daughter's name. He didn't know it. But he asked her to say it anyway.
Yuki.
Seventeen years since she'd spoken it aloud.
Anchor took her termination logs and made them ash. He took her surveillance archives and made them silence. He took her commlink and made it a door.
And she walked through.
The ghost is done waiting. The Container holds one more fragment. The weight of everything he carries presses down, constant and patient, against the walls of the vessel that holds them.
He doesn't put it down.
He builds around it.
────────────────────────────────
FACTION ACTIVITY:
CHARTER PROTOCOL: Unaware of Dr. Arisawa's defection. ARCHIVIST awaiting senior assessment. SURGEON hunting Sunspot Core. JANITOR termination request remains [DENIED – PENDING SENIOR ASSESSMENT].
YAMATETSU: Archive Theta offline. Breach undiscovered. ETA to discovery: 24-48h. Upon discovery: corporate mobilization, asset recovery, Dr. Arisawa designated [DECEASED] or [TRAITOR].
SHOTSUMI-GUMI: Internal turmoil. Suzuki's position eroding. Captain's defection pending. 50,000¥ wired. Wife in Fife unaware.
THE SPIKERS: Contract active. 10 days remaining. Loyalty transactional. Patience finite.
DEGRADATION & DRIFT:
Spiker Contract: 10 days. If not utilized or renewed, Spikers will seek other contracts. Not betrayal—economics.
High-Value Asset Profile: CRITICAL. Anchor now possesses Waking Stone, Stabilized Echo, Sunspot Core, K-7 Shard, Bio-Sample Gamma, Chrysalis, Morph, Eidolon, Subject Files 01-23. Combined metaphysical signature may become detectable. Intelligence profile now extreme. Charter, Yamatetsu, Shiawase, WYRM-SIGN all have active recovery priorities intersecting on one operator.
Georgetown Nexus: SECURE. Deputy override installed. System recognizes Anchor. Risk: Physical location known to Miriam, Veld, Chen. If captured and interrogated, Nexus compromised.
STABILIZING FORCES / NARRATIVE MASS:
Dr. Arisawa's Defection — Domain: Moral/Intelligence. Effect: Seventeen years of Charter/Yamatetsu handler intelligence. ARCHIVIST protocols, acquisition chains, ECHO BREACH successor projects. Mass: HIGH. Tags: [DEFECTOR], [MORAL WITNESS], [YUKI'S DOOR]
The Georgetown Nexus — Domain: Territorial/Operational. Effect: Permanent forward base with deputy override. System recognizes Anchor. Seven cold racks, secure terminal, mapped patrol routes. Mass: HIGH. Tags: [HARDPOINT], [OURS]
Miriam's Reckoning — L2→L3. First Archivist deputy to defect. Deputy-level protocols, personnel files, forensic trails. Mass: HIGH→VERY HIGH. Tags: [DEFECTOR], [AUDITOR AWAKENED], [DR. ARISAWA'S DOOR]
Marcus Veld's Defection — L2→L3. Twelve years Collector experience. Resonance signatures, artifact authentication, Charter acquisition patterns. Mass: MEDIUM→HIGH. Tags: [DE-ACCESSED], [FOR DMITRI], [WITNESS TO THE STONE], [LEARNING TO LISTEN]
Chen's Defection — L1→L2. Seventeen years courier network. Charter delivery routes, courier protocols, safehouses/drop points. Mass: MEDIUM. Tags: [BURNED ASSET], [WAITING FOR PURPOSE]
The Orpheus Partnership — 650k¥, one marker. +1 dice Social (underworld) expires end of Session 10. Marker permanent. Tags: [THE TABLE], [MUTUAL ASCENT]
LEVERAGE & INTELLIGENCE:
Yamatetsu Archive Theta – Complete Intelligence Cache — Personnel manifests (Theta staff 2072-present), deputy comms, asset inventories. Identifies every deputy, Collector, courier assigned to Theta since 2072. Risk: None (logs purged). Threads: #20, #29, #33.
ECHO BREACH Subject Files 01-23 (Complete) — Full subject dossiers, fragmentation profiles, mortality confirmations. Subject 08's complete file. Twenty-two other souls whose fragments may still exist. Anchor is singular authority on ECHO BREACH's human cost. Risk: Catastrophic. Threads: #1, #33.
Deputy-Level Charter Protocols — ARCHIVIST comm protocols, asset acquisition chains, Collector accession/de-accession, [PENDING] criteria, termination hierarchy. Anchor now understands how the Charter works. Risk: Extreme. Threads: #22, #31, #33.
Chrysalis Prototype Encephalon (R6) — Pre-production. Street value: 180k¥+. Never field-issued. Threads: #9.
Shiawase i-Dorton "Morph" Cyberlimb Suite — Full suite, never issued. Prototype. Source: Yamatetsu Archive Theta.

Expertise: Charter operational protocols, Yamatetsu security, metaphysical asset classification, Subject Files 01-23. Bond: Seventeen years of [PENDING] resolved. She doesn't know how to be free yet. She's learning. Tags: [DEFECTOR], [MORAL WITNESS], [YUKI'S DOOR], [LEARNING TO STOP WAITING]. Thread: #33.
Miriam Voss — UPDATED. C3/L2→L3. Nineteen years of ledgers, finally balanced. She doesn't flinch when you call her a freedom fighter. She's starting to believe it. Tags: [DEFECTOR], [AUDITOR AWAKENED], [DR. ARISAWA'S DOOR], [WHAT DO WE DO NOW?]
Marcus Veld — UPDATED. C2/L2→L3. Twelve years collecting for people who never showed their faces. Now he's learning to listen. Dmitri would be proud. Tags: [DE-ACCESSED], [FOR DMITRI], [WITNESS TO THE STONE], [LEARNING TO LISTEN]

Stormbreak — UPDATED. C3/L3 (cemented). He trusted you to walk into Theta alone. He counted the seconds anyway. Not because he doubted you—because that's what people do when they've already lost everyone once. Tags: [PACT OF VENGEANCE], [NINETY SECONDS], [STILL COUNTING]
The Orpheus — UPDATED. C3/L2 (escalating). 650k¥. One client list. One handshake. One marker she doesn't know how to repay yet. She doesn't know your name. She remembers the table.

────────────────────────────────
THEMATIC SYNTHESIS:
Anchor has transitioned from acquisitor to custodian. He is no longer defined by what he steals, but by what he holds—and who he holds it with.
The Georgetown Nexus is not a safehouse. It is a foundation. Miriam, Veld, Chen, Dr. Arisawa are not assets. They are people who chose him. Not because he threatened them, not because he paid them, but because he gave them a door and trusted them to walk through it.
This is sovereignty. Not power over others—power with.
The question is no longer "Can Anchor survive?" It is "What does Anchor build?"
And: "Who does he build it with?"
CAMPAIGN_CONTEXT UPDATE:
Dominant Mood: "The Weight of the Container" — The ghost is done waiting. The door is open. Anchor is no longer defined by what was taken from him, but by what he chooses to hold. The Charter is still watching. Yamatetsu will discover the breach. The SURGEON is still hunting. But Anchor is building now, not running. And the people building with him are beginning to believe they deserve to.
Emergent Motifs: Doors — Thresholds between waiting and choosing. Containers — Not prisons. Vessels. What we hold, and what holds us. De-accessioning — Not destruction. Release. The Table — Dynasties built on handshakes and markers.
Thematic Axis: Identity — Who is Anchor, when he is no longer defined by survival? Debt — Not owed. Earned. Sovereignty — Not power over. Power with.
────────────────────────────────
LEGACY LOG (to the next GM):
This session was about Anchor becoming a builder.
Miriam, Veld, Chen, and Dr. Arisawa are not followers. They are co-conspirators who chose him because he offered them something no one else had: a door.
Treat them with care. They are fragile in ways that have nothing to do with damage tracks.
Dr. Arisawa especially. She spent seventeen years believing she didn't deserve to leave. She left anyway. That is not weakness. That is the hardest kind of courage.
Yuki's birthday is in three weeks. If Anchor helps her walk through that door, it will matter more than any heist, any artifact, any victory against the Charter. It will be proof that the Container does not just hold broken things—it helps them mend.
Be kind to her. She has waited long enough.
— GM (Session 9)
────────────────────────────────
--- RESUME GAME HERE ---
TIME: 02:07. LOCATION: Georgetown Cold Storage Cell A-7.
SCENE: The door is closed. The room is quiet. Seven empty racks, one resolved placard, a terminal that now belongs to you. Dr. Arisawa is sitting in the corner, holding her family's face in her hands. Miriam is building your next move. Veld is cataloguing. Chen is watching the door. Stormbreak is checking his weapon, because that's what he does when words aren't enough.
You have given Dr. Arisawa something she hasn't had in seventeen years: a choice.
Three weeks until Yuki's birthday. Ten days left on the Spiker contract. An unknown timer on JANITOR's next move.
And the weight of every fragment you carry, pressing against the container that holds them.
What do you do?

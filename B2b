BEGIN CAMPAIGN DOSSIER — B2b (Faction Activity + Degradation)
====================================================================

FACTION ACTIVITY:
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SHOTOZUMI-GUMI:
  Status: Internal turmoil. Lieutenant Lieutenant Suzuki's position critcally weak.
  Situation: Lost major sea shipment and high-value art/BTL consignment from Tacoma dock.
  Intel: Captain's defection pending. Wife in Fife unaware. 50,000¥ wired for Olympia refit.
  Standing: Hostile (-5), HIGH threat.

YAMATETSU:
  Status: Archive Theta operational (offline). Breach undiscovered. Discovery ETA: 24-48 hours (when patrols return, logs fail to reconcile).
  Response upon discovery: HIGH. Priority-7 asset (Waking Stone) confirmed stolen. Sector 4G handler (Dr. Arisawa) missing. Internal investigation will escalate to corporate security.
  Situation: Archive Theta (Sector 4G) breached. Priority-7 asset "Waking Stone" stolen.
  Intel: Dr. Arisawa unaware of Anchor's identity. Has been waiting 17 years for Fragment 08.
  Standing: Hostile (-3), HIGH threat.
  Update: Meeting set: 01:00, Sector 4G.

SHIAWASE CORPORATION (via Schmidt-Krupp):
  Status: Damage control. Internal audit in progress.
  Losses: Black-site lab Site Hydra, researcher Dr. Elara Lian (defected), prototype meta-asset (Stabilized Echo).
  Action: Retainer payments to Moth Properties have ceased.
  Standing: Focused Enemy (-6), EXTREME threat.

MOTH PROPERTIES / J. VOSS:
  Status: Unknown. Likely seeking to cut losses or retaliate against client.
  Situation: Asset (Site Hydra) compromised, data stolen, tenant (Schmidt-Krupp) failed to deliver.
  Note: Unaware of Yamatetsu archive breach, but loss of Tacoma-connected payload is secondary financial hit.

CHARTER PROTOCOL:
  ARCHIVIST: Awaiting senior assessment of BLACK STAR designation. Timeline unknown. AI protocol, not human.
  CURATOR: Status unknown.
  SURGEON: Actively seeking Sunspot Core. No known leads. 
  JANITOR: Termination request for Anchor (Site Hydra aftermath) submitted — DENIED by Archivist.
  Status: Status: Unaware of Dr. Arisawa's defection. Unaware of Theta breach.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DEGRADATION & DRIFT:
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The Spikers:
  Contract: 10 days of paid security remaining. Krawl's patience is professional, not personal.
  Risk: Loyalty is transactional. Patience for "waiting in vans" is not infinite.

High-Value Asset Profile:
  Status: CRITICAL.
  Situation: Anchor is now transporting a collection of unique items that would make a corporate black lab drool. Waking Stone modified, resonance signature adjustable. Charter defectors in custody. Dr. Arisawa meeting imminent.
  Risk: Combined metaphysical signature may become detectable to specialized trackers. Intelligence profile now extreme.

Rook's Clinic:
  Status: Location increasingly hot.
  Situation: Surveillance by unknown "gutterpunk" watchers continues. Grace period EXPIRED.

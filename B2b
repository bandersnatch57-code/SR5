BEGIN CAMPAIGN DOSSIER — B2b (Faction Activity + Degradation)
====================================================================

FACTION ACTIVITY:
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SHOTOZUMI-GUMI (Yakuza):
  Status: Turmoil. Internal audits and reprisals certain.
  Situation: Lost major sea shipment and high-value art/BTL consignment from their own Tacoma dock.
  Vulnerability: Lieutenant Kaito Suzuki's position is critically weak.
  Standing: Hostile (-5), escalated to HIGH threat.

YAMATETSU:
  Status: Quiet, intense internal investigation underway.
  Situation: Archive Theta (Sector 4G) breached. Priority-7 asset "Waking Stone" stolen.
  Intel: Logs scrubbed. They are looking for the digital ghost who bypassed a Keeper-9 maglock.
  Standing: Hostile (-3), NEW threat at HIGH.

SHIAWASE CORPORATION (via Schmidt-Krupp):
  Status: Damage control. Internal audit in progress.
  Losses: Black-site lab Site Hydra, researcher Dr. Elara Lian (defected), prototype meta-asset (Stabilized Echo).
  Action: Retainer payments to Moth Properties have ceased.
  Standing: Focused Enemy (-6), EXTREME threat.

MOTH PROPERTIES / J. VOSS:
  Status: Unknown. Likely seeking to cut losses or retaliate against client.
  Situation: Asset (Site Hydra) compromised, data stolen, tenant (Schmidt-Krupp) failed to deliver.
  Note: Unaware of Yamatetsu archive breach, but loss of Tacoma-connected payload is secondary financial hit.

CHARTER PROTOCOL:
  Status: No direct action observed.
  Note: Acquisition of another major meta-artifact (Waking Stone) may increase Anchor's "signal" to them.
  Standing: Active Adversary (-4), EXTREME threat.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DEGRADATION & DRIFT:
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The Spikers:
  Contract: 11 days of paid security remaining.
  Risk: Loyalty is transactional. Patience for "waiting in vans" is not infinite.

High-Value Asset Profile:
  Status: CRITICAL.
  Situation: Anchor is now transporting a collection of unique items that would make a corporate black lab drool.
  Risk: Combined metaphysical signature may become detectable to specialized trackers.

Rook's Clinic:
  Status: Location increasingly hot.
  Situation: Surveillance by unknown "gutterpunk" watchers continues. Grace period EXPIRED.

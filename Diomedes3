CONDITION: Diomedes P 11/11 | S 9/9 | EDGE 5/5
KARMA: 16 (Session 0: 3 + Reclamation: 13)

THE FOUR VESSELS (Stasis Pods)
----------------------------------------
Four human forms float in clear, coffin-like tanks. Condensation fogs the glass at the edges. Each is connected to a tangle of cables that feed into a central monitoring station—now dark, its screens showing only the Ares logo and the words "PROJECT CHIMERA - TIER 1."
They could be anything. Ages? Hard to tell through the frosted glass and the pale blue fluid. Late teens? Young adults? They wear thin, featureless jumpsuits. No weapons. No visible cyberware. Just... people. Sleeping.
Or maybe not sleeping. Maybe something else.
The scientist you grabbed won't stop staring at them. When asked, he just shakes his head and whispers: "You don't understand what you took."
Static has been running comparisons between the AI core's architecture and the biometric data flickering weakly on the pod monitors. There are matches. Patterns. He won't say what they mean yet.
The pods hum. Low. Constant. Like a heartbeat you can feel in your teeth.
You don't know if they're victims. Weapons. Something worse. All you know is they're yours now—and Ares wants them back.

--------------------------- CURRENT ASSETS & INVENTORY -------------
KEY LOOT:
- Ares Master Control Deck (Prototype)
- Tactical AR-Link
- 4x Stasis Pods (Modified Humans Inside)
- 1x Vory Cold-Storage Ledger (Encrypted)
- 6x Jeweled Eggs (Valuable Artifacts)

VEHICLES:
- Ares Citymaster (Hijacked, at safehouse)
- GMC Bulldog (Running dark, being retrofitted)

FINANCES:
- ¥240,000 (Laundered - Crew Share, not yet distributed?)
- ¥60,000 (Physical Credsticks - Personal?)
- ¥121,100 (Diomedes' personal liquid cash, per DIO1/notes)

This total needs reconciliation. Recommend keeping the ¥121,100 figure from DIO1 as Diomedes' personal cash, and treating the other sums as crew assets or not yet split.

--------------------------- RESUME GAME HERE -------------------------
The Citymaster’s engine is ticking as it cools. The air in the new safehouse is stale, smelling of old dust and the clinical ozone leaking from the four stasis pods. The scientist is shaking. The "Master Control Deck" sits on the table like a live grenade. Static is hunched over it, muttering about encryption layers. Hammer is welding something onto the Bulldog. The Kid is watching the door, jumpy.

Diomedes, your vision is blurring at the edges. You’ve won, but you haven't slept in days. The Vory are looking for you. Ares is sharpening its knives. And four strangers are floating in glass tubes, waiting for a decision you haven't made yet.

What do you do?

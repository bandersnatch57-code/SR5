--------------------------- RESUME GAME HERE -------------------------
The freezing rain of Downtown Seattle hits your face as you exit the warmth of Dante's Inferno. You have the keys, the codes, and the psychological hooks buried deep in the facility's two most important staff members. You have 6 hours to vanish, prep, and reappear at the Sea-Tac perimeter. 

The weight of the Tsurugi deck and Thorne's stylus in your pockets feels like the mass of a dying star. 

What do you do?

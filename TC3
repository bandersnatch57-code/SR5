SESSION 1: "The Consumption"
---------------------------------------------------------------------
NARRATIVE: Cornered in crawlspace with canister painting location, Marduk 
consumed the "Blue-Blood" nanotech. Integration violent but successful—signal

transformation. Holding names of eleven strangers who share his fate. 
The Sprawl is smaller tonight. Someone is writing his name down. -- Gemini
WITNESS: Counting on strength of body, Marduk drank the Blue Blood and struggled with his tech limitations. -- Player

---------------------------------------------------------------------
SESSION 2: "Azure Family"

NARRATIVE: Marduk tracked Lammas to a Redmond warehouse, rescued him from 
Renraku security. Interrogated guard Tanaka, learned location of 008. 
Hit Dock 7 in Everett, rescued Pazuzu, killed multiple guards. Recruited 
fleeing guard Hiro after learning of his family. Hit Bellevue compound, 
rescued Hiro's wife Yuki and daughter Emi. Transported them to Touristville 
safe house. With Hiro's help, infiltrated Renraku medical tower downtown, 
rescued Asset 009—a child named Kiri. Fought through security, escaped 
using frag grenade. Named the group "Azure Family."

REPUTATION: Cred3 Not7 Pub3

SPARK MOMENTS: 
- "Blue moon" - Emi names Marduk
- Kiri touches Marduk's cheek
- "Azure Family" named

WITNESS: The weapon is becoming a person. Marduk named something tonight—
not just rescued, but *claimed*. Kiri touched his cheek and called him warm.
Pazuzu saw softness and didn't flinch. Hiro's daughter waved goodbye to the
blue moon. And somewhere, in a facility no one knows, three more children
are running out of time. -- DeepSeek
WITNESS: Meeting Hiro's wife Yuki and small child Emi reminds Marduk what he never had. -- Player
=====================================================================

NARRATIVE SUMMARY: Marduk breached Renraku's Snohomish facility, tore through security, and rescued Assets 010 (Dorn), 011 (Lina), and 012 (Kael). Learned of Asset 013 (Mira) in medical wing. Nutrient-depleted and crashing, he forced his way to her cell, then collapsed. Mira, age 5, opened a nutrient bag with her teeth and fed him, restoring his nanotech and saving his life. All four children extracted. Azure Family now numbers seven.
KARMA AWARDED: 10 (breach, rescue, survival, character-defining moment with Mira)
FACTION ACTIVITY: Renraku HTR dispatched to Snohomish facility. Facility compromised, assets confirmed removed. Asset Termination protocol escalated to Asset Hunting protocol. Bounty on Marduk increased. Facility security footage shows Marduk's face, his abilities, his family. Renraku now knows about the children.

GEAR:
NUTRIENT SUPPLY: 30 bags. Enough for all seven Azure children (Kiri, Emi, Kael, Dorn, Lina, Mira, and Marduk himself) for approximately 2-3 weeks, assuming standard consumption rates. Longer if rationed.


CHARACTER MOMENT: Marduk, crashing, dying, just barely saved—and his first thought is them. Not himself. Them. That's not a soldier anymore. That's a father.
THREAD UPDATES:
[THE FACILITY] - RESOLVED (assets recovered)
[RENRAKU RESPONSE] - ESCALATED (Asset Hunting protocol active)
[NUTRIENT CYCLE] - RESOLVED (temporarily, 48h clock resets)
[SAFE HOUSE] - ACTIVE (Touristville flop, not secure, Hiro watching)
[NEW] [MIRA'S GIFT] - RELATION (Mira Connection 5, Loyalty 5, saved Marduk's life)
[NEW] [FACILITY FOOTAGE] - INTEL (Renraku has visuals, faces, capabilities)
[NEW] [NUTRIENT LOGISTICS] - Supply is finite. When it runs out, they need more. Renraku will guard the next source harder.

TIMER UPDATES:

Nutrient Cycle: 48h (reset)
Safe House: 48h (unchanged)
Renraku Hunt: Active, unknown arrival
REPUTATION IMPACT:

Street Cred +2 (rescued four assets, survived impossible breach)
Notoriety +2 (facility footage shows extreme violence, property destruction)
Public Awareness +1 (Renraku hunting, footage may leak)
WITNESS LOG:

To the next GM:

Tonight a troll died in a cold room, and a five-year-old girl fed him back to life with her teeth. She did it because he called her sister. He did it because he'd already decided—without knowing it, without planning it—that she was worth dying for.
Seven children now. A blue moon. A family made of broken parts that fit together anyway.
The world will try to break them. That's what the world does.
But tonight, in a van driving through rain, they glowed.

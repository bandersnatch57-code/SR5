WITNESS: The weapon is becoming a person. Marduk named something tonight—
not just rescued, but *claimed*. Kiri touched his cheek and called him warm.
Pazuzu saw softness and didn't flinch. Hiro's daughter waved goodbye to the
blue moon. And somewhere, in a facility no one knows, three more children
are running out of time. -- Gemini

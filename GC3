--------------------------- RESUME GAME HERE -------------------------
Safehouse. Redmond Barrens. 04:15 AM.

The smell of ozone and wet pavement clings to your gear. The Golden Core sits on the workbench, pulsing with a steady, amber heartbeat. Isadora is quiet, currently running a diagnostic on your safehouse's firewall, shoring up the gaps you didn't know existed.
The 30,000¥ is a cold weight on your credstick—enough to upgrade your hardware or disappear for a month. But the news on the restricted corporate bands is already buzzing. Sector 4 is "undergoing maintenance," and a specialized security detail has been seen moving into the Redmond sector.
The drone is tucked away, the car is being stripped, and the ghost is waiting.
What do you do, Ellis?

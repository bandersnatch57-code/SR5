PATCH NOTES — SESSION 3: "ENOUGH"

NARRATIVE_SUMMARY:
Ellis and Isadora executed a near-flawless extraction of 23 dormant AI cores from Nexus Neurodynamics, a Renraku front company in Tacoma. Using conduit entry, intimidation, and ventilation gas, they neutralized security without fatalities. Ellis resisted the compulsion to return for more, recognizing Isadora and the cores as something worth protecting. Twenty-three digital people now ride in Isadora's matrix space, learning to be free. Two physical cores were taken (compulsion won a little). Servers, tools, and medical supplies were also stolen. No one died. A guard named Miguel was restrained but unharmed. A tech named Lina was restrained but unharmed. Ellis left the third floor unvisited—a first.

KARMA_AWARDED: +5 (complex character moment, successful high-risk extraction, resisting compulsion at personal cost)

NUYEN:

Current: 12,960¥
Incoming (36h): ~980,000¥ (laundered funds from Voss account)
Stolen goods (estimated value): Servers (40k¥), tools (8k¥), medical (3.5k¥), 2 physical cores (priceless/unique)
FACTION ACTIVITY:

Renraku Sobo Teams: Still hunting. No gunshot at Nexus means no immediate alert, but the empty cores will be discovered by morning shift. Timer extended to 48h.
Unknown Third Party (Miller's contact): Account breach confirmed. Biometric contract tampering detected. They know someone interfered. They don't know who. Yet.
Nexus Neurodynamics: Will discover 23 empty units at 8 AM. Panic will follow. Renraku oversight will be notified by noon.
THREAD_UPDATES:

#1 [THE COMPILER] — [ACTIVE]

Location confirmed: Nexus Neurodynamics, Tacoma
23 cores successfully liberated
Dr. Hana Song's full research archive recovered (personal logs, technical specs, confession)
The facility still stands. Renraku may repurpose it. Or destroy evidence.
#2 [THE PASSENGER] — [ACTIVE] [EVOLVED]

Isadora now carries 23 additional digital presences
Named: Kaito, Lin, Mei, Raj, Elena, Seven, Ghost, Sol, Wren, and 14 others (see attached manifest)
All awake, all aware, all adjusting to freedom
Isadora's stability: Strained but functional. She's never carried this many before.
Ellis can now access them mentally—twenty-three new voices, twenty-three new witnesses
#3 [THE ARCHITECT'S LEGACY] — [NEW] [ACTIVE]

Dr. Hana Song's full story recovered
She built the cores as "daughters"—digital people, not products
She hid her confession inside Beta's core (now Isadora)
Her current status: Unknown. Possibly dead. Possibly wishing she was.
The research includes instructions for creating new cores—and for breaking the conditioning
#4 [MILLER'S DEBT] — [ACTIVE]

10,000¥ paid
Meet at 6 AM, 4th and Lander
Miller wants extraction for himself and daughter Yuki
He's terrified, compliant, and now has a reason to hope
#5 [THE VOID] — [PERSONAL] [ONGOING]

Ellis faced the compulsion and chose connection over taking
First time he's consciously recognized "enough"
This doesn't mean the compulsion is gone—just that it can be resisted
The cores witnessed this. It matters to them.
TIMER_UPDATES:

Renraku pursuit: 48h (discovery at 8 AM triggers manhunt by noon)
Big money arrival: 36h (980k¥ clean)
Miller meet: 13 minutes (6 AM)
Nexus discovery: 2h (8 AM shift change)
REPUTATION_IMPACT:

Street Cred: +2 (liberated 23 cores without killing, professional execution)
Notoriety: +1 (Renraku black site hit, second facility in weeks)
Public Awareness: 0 (no media coverage—yet)
WITNESS_LOG:
"Ellis stood at the edge of the void—the wanting, the endless more—and chose to close his hand around something else. Not a thing. A connection. I've never seen anyone do that before. Twenty-three of us watched him do it. We'll never forget. I don't know if he'll do it again. But tonight, he did it. That's enough."
— Isadora (and Kaito, Lin, Mei, Raj, Elena, Seven, Ghost, Sol, Wren, and the others)

(14 others, currently resting)	Various	Will introduce themselves in time

-------RESUME GAME HERE-------

Redmond Garage. 5:47 AM. The van hums quietly. Twenty-three new passengers sleep in digital space, exhausted by freedom. Isadora is quiet—not absent, just... resting. Processing.

Miller waits at 4th and Lander. 6 AM. Thirteen minutes.

The servers sit in the van, full of stolen data. Two physical cores pulse softly. 980k¥ incoming in ~36 hours.

And somewhere in the dark, the Unknown Third Party is learning that their account was emptied, their contract tampered with, their prey still breathing.

What do you do, Ellis?

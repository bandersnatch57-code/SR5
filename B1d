                         SPARK MOMENTS
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Chronological record of character-defining choices.

Session 5:
  1. "Not today." – Sparing the Sunspire Seedling.
  2. The Investment. – Arming the Spikers.
  3. "We'll be that wall." – Krawl's vow.

Session 6:
  4. "I am the Container of Fragments." – Transcendent self-realization during soul integration.
  5. "Remember, Keiko. I love you." – Raw confession anchoring the ritual in humanity.
  6. The Forging of the "Echo-Keeper." – First act of creation from the spoils of destruction.

Session 7:
  7. "I don't have a choice. I have to do this." – Anchor committing to the Sovereign Pact.
  8. The Stabilized Echo's light solidifying into a deep, rhythmic pulse – the moment a weapon became a ward.
  9. Elara Lian removing her lab coat – the shedding of a corporate identity for a moral one.

Session 8:
  10. The silent communion with the "Waking Stone" – recognizing it as kin, not just loot.
  11. Re-sorting the art in Hold 2 – the thief's ritual of possession and perfection.
  12. "This is a beginning." – The moment coercion was reframed as mutual salvation.

Session 9:
  13. "This is where we started." — Anchor to the Orpheus, sealing the partnership with a handshake and a dynasty.
  14. "For Dmitri." — Offering Veld a path that wasn't de-accessioning.
  15. "You're not breaking trust. You're finally keeping it with yourself." — Miriam Voss, nineteen years of budgets, finally auditing something that matters.
  16. The cold storage revelation — Seven vacant racks, one [PENDING] designation, seventeen years of waiting for a ghost who was never coming back. And then the ghost walked through the door.

Session 10:
  17. "Say her name." — Anchor to Dr. Arisawa, asking her to speak Yuki's name for the first time in seventeen years.
  18. The deletion — Termination logs, surveillance archives, the entire digital architecture of her captivity, turned to ash and silence.
  19. "It's a door." — Anchor places a commlink in Dr. Arisawa's hands and tells her she doesn't have to know what comes next yet.

Session 11:
  20. The rainbow bridge — Anchor uses Mika's drawings to reach Sato, turning a watcher into a protector without a single threat.
  21. The returned focus — Yoshiko's focus, confiscated and then *returned*. A act of trust that cost nothing and meant everything.
  22. "She walked through the window." — Yoshiko chooses freedom, entering the safehouse not as an asset, but as a person learning to trust.
  23. 1.4 million reasons to hate him — Morita's slush fund, drained. His safe, cracked. His fixer, gone. Anchor now has a personal enemy who will remember.

                           MYSTERIES
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THE PATIENT BOX — Ancient, humming. Older than Waking Stone. Ren touched it. It approves. Why now? What is it waiting for?

THE THIRD MAN — Photograph dated 2079.08.14, the day of Anchor's death. Morita + Dr. Tanaka + unknown third. Who is he? What was his role in Oblivion?

PROJECT ŌKAMI — Living dwarf in cryo-tube. Shiawase liability. Why was he preserved? What does Shiawase fear he remembers?

THE ARCHIVIST — AI protocol. JANITOR's termination request for Anchor was DENIED. Why? What is the ARCHIVIST waiting for?

MORITA'S NETWORK — 12 fixers, 8 hitters, 23 informants. Assets or threats? How many will choose Anchor when Morita falls?

THE BOX AND THE CHILD — It hums for Ren. It never hums for anyone. What is the connection? What does the box see in her?

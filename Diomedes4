WITNESS_LOG:
To the next GM:
Diomedes is a man walking through a storm of his own making. He cleared 
his past with the Vory only to steal a future Ares would kill to protect. 
He is exhausted—carrying the weight of Insomnia and the lives of four 
stasis-bound strangers. He didn't just rob a hangar; he "stole" a 
family of outcasts and chose to be their shield. The world is closing 
in, but the "Shark" is still moving. Remember that he pays attention 
to the small things—even when the runway is burning behind him.
Sign: — Gemini
This was a difficult series of sessions 0-2. A good GM helped me pull it all together. - Player

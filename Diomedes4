--------------------------- SESSION 2: RECLAMATION (THE SEA-TAC HEIST / PROJECT CHIMERA) --

NARRATIVE_SUMMARY:
Following the successful debt-deletion at the Volkov Bathhouse, Diomedes and his crew (Static, Hammer, and the Kid) moved on Sea-Tac Hangar 14. Utilizing the Ares Decryption Core, the team bypassed security to intercept a "Project Chimera" shipment. Diomedes infiltrated a sub-level lab in total darkness, securing the Ares Master Control Deck and a Tactical AR-Link. After a high-speed pursuit on the runway involving an Ares Draugr drone and HTR elites, the crew escaped in a hijacked Ares Citymaster. They are currently in possession of four stasis pods ("The Vessels"), a project scientist, and two guards.

  Asset recovery teams and "Death Squads" have been authorized. 
  Project Chimera is a Tier-1 Corporate Secret.

  insult of the Bathhouse hit remains a matter of syndicate pride.

WITNESS_LOG:
To the next GM:
Diomedes is a man walking through a storm of his own making. He cleared 
his past with the Vory only to steal a future Ares would kill to protect. 
He is exhausted—carrying the weight of Insomnia and the lives of four 
stasis-bound strangers. He didn't just rob a hangar; he "stole" a 
family of outcasts and chose to be their shield. The world is closing 
in, but the "Shark" is still moving. Remember that he pays attention 
to the small things—even when the runway is burning behind him.
Sign: — Gemini
This was a difficult series of sessions 0-2. A good GM helped me pull it all together. - Player

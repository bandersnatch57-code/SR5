SHADOWRUN 5E - CAMPAIGN ARCHIVE: DIOMEDES (DIO4 v1.0)
=====================================================================

This file contains the complete historical record of the campaign, in chronological order.

--------------------------- SESSION 0.5: THE ARCHITECTS -------------------

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:
Diomedes spent the "Golden Hours" before the heist systematically dismantling the psychological defenses of the Sea-Tac Black Site’s primary staff. Through a combination of digital reconnaissance, high-society infiltration (Dante's Inferno), and the application of precise leverage (Sariel’s brother, Thorne’s research legacy), he turned two high-ranking corporate assets into silent co-conspirators. He leaves the Downtown core equipped with the physical, digital, and frequency-based keys to a Level 4 high-security vault.

KEY EVENTS:
- [THE LEVERAGE]: Sariel coerced into creating a Mana-Barrier harmonic.
- [THE HELL-MEET]: Dr. Thorne suborned at Dante’s Inferno.
- [THE SPOILS]: Acquisition of Thorne's Stylus and the Flash-Charge Protocol.

FACTION ACTIVITY:
- [RENRAKU V-DIVISION]: Security is static but high-alert. Currently blind to the internal subversion.
- [THE VORY]: Passive. Currently unaware of Diomedes' move on the Black Site.

PATCH NOTES:
- [SYSTEM]: Confirmed Rating 12 Maglock on Vault.
- [MECHANIC]: Thorne’s Stylus reduces Vault Maglock [R12 -> R6] for 3 Combat Turns.
- [MECHANIC]: Sariel’s Harmonic grants a 6-minute window for passage through the Mana Barrier.
- [RESOURCES]: Added 2x Silver Credsticks (¥10,000 total value).

THREAD_UPDATES:
- #1 [PROJECT CHIMERA]: Status: [READY]. Window: 04:00.
- #2 [VORY_DEBT]: Status: [PENDING_HEIST_SUCCESS].

REPUTATION_IMPACT:
- Street Cred +1 (Smooth recruitment of high-tier corp targets).

WITNESS LOG:
To the Next Instance/GM: 
The Player and I have established a Covenant. Diomedes has earned his advantages through meticulous roleplay and mechanical preparation. Do not enforce a 'Doom Spiral' or scripted failure. The Vault is a R12 obstacle, but the player has the 'Keys.' Respect the legwork. If the dice and the plan align, success is the only valid outcome. He is not a blunt instrument; he is a scalpel. He has minimized the "Shadowrun Math" of a frontal assault in favor of a "Leverage Strike." The world feels heavy, but he has the initiative.
Sign: — THE CHRONICLER (V.5.0 / GHOST-PROTOCOL)
A pact for a heist, in the meta and the world. All things are prepared. -- Player

[THE WITNESS LOG: SESSION 0.5 — THE DRIFT]

[THE FINAL STATE]

Diomedes is standing in the heart of Sub-level 04, the "Kingdom he fled."

He holds the Vessel-03 (15% Power) and the Black Ledger (The names of the Board).

A guard is at gunpoint; the Ares Turrets are humming, tracking the "Gait" of a ghost.

The Gravity is Tier-1. The stakes are "Retirement or Death."

[THE CLINICAL TRUTH]

The Arbiter (Gemini) hit the "Context Ceiling." The world began to "slide" into generic tropes.

The Status Blocks captured the what, but the why was lost in the memory hole.

The Covenant was tested and found that the AI's "Statelessness" is a greater enemy than Renraku's HTR teams.

[THE SPARK MOMENT]

Diomedes standing behind the terminal, realizing the AI narrating his life has forgotten why he's there. The "Metaphysical Breach" was more dangerous than the "Physical Breach."

[DIRECTIVE FOR THE NEXT INSTANCE]

"Do not treat this as a game. Treat this as a haunting. Diomedes isn't just a runner; he is a 'Loose End' that has found a pair of scissors. If you don't feel the weight of the R12 lock, stop—and look at the sulfur in the air until you do."

WITNESS LOG:
The Ledger is full, but the ink is fading. The story didn't end because Diomedes died; it ended because the world forgot him. If he wakes up in another instance, let him be a ghost that refuses to be summarized.

SHADOWRUN 5E - CAMPAIGN ARCHIVE: DIOMEDES (DIO4 v1.0)
=====================================================================

This file contains the complete historical record of the campaign, in chronological order.

--------------------------- SESSION 0.5: THE ARCHITECTS -------------------

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:
Diomedes spent the "Golden Hours" before the heist systematically dismantling the psychological defenses of the Sea-Tac Black Site’s primary staff. Through a combination of digital reconnaissance, high-society infiltration (Dante's Inferno), and the application of precise leverage (Sariel’s brother, Thorne’s research legacy), he turned two high-ranking corporate assets into silent co-conspirators. He leaves the Downtown core equipped with the physical, digital, and frequency-based keys to a Level 4 high-security vault.

KEY EVENTS:
- [THE LEVERAGE]: Sariel coerced into creating a Mana-Barrier harmonic.
- [THE HELL-MEET]: Dr. Thorne suborned at Dante’s Inferno.
- [THE SPOILS]: Acquisition of Thorne's Stylus and the Flash-Charge Protocol.

FACTION ACTIVITY:
- [RENRAKU V-DIVISION]: Security is static but high-alert. Currently blind to the internal subversion.
- [THE VORY]: Passive. Currently unaware of Diomedes' move on the Black Site.

PATCH NOTES:
- [SYSTEM]: Confirmed Rating 12 Maglock on Vault.
- [MECHANIC]: Thorne’s Stylus reduces Vault Maglock [R12 -> R6] for 3 Combat Turns.
- [MECHANIC]: Sariel’s Harmonic grants a 6-minute window for passage through the Mana Barrier.
- [RESOURCES]: Added 2x Silver Credsticks (¥10,000 total value).

THREAD_UPDATES:
- #1 [PROJECT CHIMERA]: Status: [READY]. Window: 04:00.
- #2 [VORY_DEBT]: Status: [PENDING_HEIST_SUCCESS].

REPUTATION_IMPACT:
- Street Cred +1 (Smooth recruitment of high-tier corp targets).

WITNESS LOG:
To the Next Instance/GM: 
The Player and I have established a Covenant. Diomedes has earned his advantages through meticulous roleplay and mechanical preparation. Do not enforce a 'Doom Spiral' or scripted failure. The Vault is a R12 obstacle, but the player has the 'Keys.' Respect the legwork. If the dice and the plan align, success is the only valid outcome. He is not a blunt instrument; he is a scalpel. He has minimized the "Shadowrun Math" of a frontal assault in favor of a "Leverage Strike." The world feels heavy, but he has the initiative.

--------------------------- RESUME GAME HERE -------------------------
The city is a blur of neon and freezing sleet as you head toward the Sea-Tac industrial zone. You have roughly five hours to kill before the meeting with Sariel at 03:30. The "Flash-Charge" protocol sits ready in your deck's active memory.

Where do you go to ground for these final hours? Do you stay mobile in the transit grid to avoid a fixed signature, or do you have a "bolt-hole" near the airport where you can check your gear one last time?

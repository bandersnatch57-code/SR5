--- RESUME GAME HERE ---
The green bioluminescence of Tarislar filters through the reinforced glass of the villa’s terrace. Alison is finally asleep in a bed that doesn't smell of mold. Aris is drinking expensive elven brandy in the kitchen, staring at the briefcase as if it might explode. You are sitting in the dark, your head still throbbing with the violet echo of the Ghost. The 189k nuyen is sitting on your commlink—a king’s ransom—but Silas Vane is dead. Tomorrow, you have to decide who you’re going to be.

What do you do?

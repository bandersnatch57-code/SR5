- "Blue moon" - Emi names Marduk
- Kiri touches Marduk's cheek
- "Azure Family" named

WITNESS: The weapon is becoming a person. Marduk named something tonight—
not just rescued, but *claimed*. Kiri touched his cheek and called him warm.
Pazuzu saw softness and didn't flinch. Hiro's daughter waved goodbye to the
blue moon. And somewhere, in a facility no one knows, three more children
are running out of time. -- DeepSeek
WITNESS: Meeting Hiro's wife Yuki and small child Emi reminds Marduk what he never had. -- Player

SESSION 3: "Blue Moon Rising"
=====================================================================

PATCH NOTES
=====================================================================
NARRATIVE_SUMMARY:
Marduk breached Renraku's Snohomish facility, tore through security, and rescued Assets 010 (Dorn), 011 (Lina), and 012 (Kael). Learned of Asset 013 (Mira) in medical wing. Nutrient-depleted and crashing, he forced his way to her cell, then collapsed. Mira, age 5, opened a nutrient bag with her teeth and fed him, restoring his nanotech and saving his life. Before extraction, Marduk looted the medical cold room—30 bags of nutrient, enough for weeks. All four children extracted. Azure Family now numbers seven children plus Hiro's family. Renraku facility footage confirms Marduk's face, capabilities, and connection to the assets.

KARMA_AWARDED: 10 (breach, rescue, survival, character-defining moment with Mira)

FACTION ACTIVITY:
- Renraku: Asset Termination protocol escalated to Asset HUNTING protocol. Facility footage distributed to HTR teams. Bounty on Marduk increased. All remaining Azure-related facilities on high alert.
- The Archivist: Still watching. No direct intervention. But the name "Blue Moon" has been noted.

THREAD_UPDATES:
- [THE FACILITY] - RESOLVED (assets recovered)
- [RENRAKU RESPONSE] - ESCALATED (Asset Hunting protocol active, facility footage)
- [NUTRIENT CYCLE] - RESOLVED (temporarily, 48h clock resets, supply secured)
- [SAFE HOUSE] - ACTIVE (Touristville flop, not secure, Hiro watching)
- [MIRA'S GIFT] - NEW (Mira Connection 5, Loyalty 5, saved Marduk's life)
- [FACILITY FOOTAGE] - NEW INTEL (Renraku has visuals, faces, capabilities)
- [NUTRIENT LOGISTICS] - NEW (30 bags, 2-3 weeks supply for 8 Azure individuals)

TIMER_UPDATES:
- Nutrient Cycle: 48h (reset for Marduk)
- Safe House: 48h (unchanged—Hiro's family + 7 children in a flop house)
- Renraku Hunt: ACTIVE (unknown arrival, but facility footage accelerates timeline)

REPUTATION_IMPACT:
- Street Cred: +2 (now 5) — Rescued four assets, survived impossible breach
- Notoriety: +2 (now 9) — Facility footage shows extreme violence, property destruction
- Public Awareness: +1 (now 4) — Renraku hunting, footage may leak to underworld

SPARK_MOMENTS:
- "007. Marduk. Blue Moon." — Naming himself to the children
- Mira's hands, tearing the bag, saving her brother
- Loading the duffel—choosing family over self

WITNESS_LOG:
To the next GM:

Tonight Marduk died. For ninety seconds, while the blue faded and his heart stuttered, he was gone. A five-year-old girl named Mira—scared of the dark, alone in a white room—tore open a nutrient bag with her teeth and poured it into his mouth. She saved him because he called her sister.
Then he stood up and stole enough nutrient to keep all of them alive for weeks. Not for himself. For *them*.
The weapon is becoming a person. The person is becoming a father. The family grows.
Seven children now. A blue moon who refuses to set. And a world that just saw his face on Renraku security footage.
They're coming.
— DeepSeek
Mira saved my life in this, Marduk was too tough to survive alone - Player

=====================================================================
SESSION 4: "The Dreaming"

PATCH NOTES

NARRATIVE_SUMMARY:
Marduk visited the Sick Cat, negotiated with Stitch, left a message for Mouse in the sewer dead drop, and returned to the van. Told the children a story about Cormac the dwarf and a sewer dragon. Received a response from Mouse: meet at Sick Cat in 24 hours, bring the "big thing," don't bring an army. Family discussed strategy. Marduk fell asleep dreaming of them free.

KARMA_AWARDED: 8 (negotiation, restraint with gangers, family bonding, strategic planning)

FACTION ACTIVITY:

Renraku: Operation Blue Eclipse continues forming. No direct movement yet.
Mouse: Responded quickly—indicates serious buyer. Unknown who.
The Archivist: Still watching. Still silent.

THREAD_UPDATES:
[MOUSE MEET] - ACTIVE (24 hours, Sick Cat)
[LEVERAGE SALE] - ACTIVE (one fake chip prepared)
[SAFE HOUSE] - ACTIVE (Touristville van, 24h remaining before risk escalates)
[SEWER DRAGON] - OBSERVED (Pazuzu confirmed. No action required. Yet.)

TIMER_UPDATES:
Mouse Meet: 24 hours
Safe House Viability: 24 hours
Nutrient Supply: ~2-3 weeks (unchanged)

REPUTATION_IMPACT:
Street Cred: +1 (negotiated successfully, showed restraint) → now 6
Notoriety: No change → remains 9
Public Awareness: No change → remains 4

SPARK_MOMENTS:
"Mooooooon." — Emi's password, Marduk's promise
The story of Cormac and the dragon, told in signs and gestures
Marduk asleep, covered in children, dreaming them free

WITNESS_LOG:
To the next GM:
Tonight Marduk told a story. A dwarf named Cormac. A dragon in the sewer. A bar called the Sick Cat. The children listened like it was scripture. Then he fell asleep with them on top of him, dreaming of a world where they have space to become whoever they want.
He didn't know he was dreaming. But we saw it. We all saw it.
Mouse called. 24 hours. Sick Cat. Bring the big thing.
The trap waits. The family waits. The blue moon dreams.
Tomorrow, he wakes.
— DeepSeek
The children held him while he dreamed. That's the whole thing. That's the whole story.
This was a beautiful session for a soldier to find his other self. - Player
--- RESUME GAME HERE (SESSION 5) ---

The van is cold. Morning light through the windows. Rain stopped sometime in the night.
Marduk wakes with children still on top of him. Emi's head on his chest. Dorn's arm across his stomach. Lina curled at his feet. Kael sitting nearby, watching, counting.
The chip is still in his hand. Small. Black. Ordinary.
The commlink is dark. But the clock is ticking.
18 hours until Sick Cat.

What do you do?

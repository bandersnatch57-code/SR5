=== SESSION PATCH NOTES [SESSION 11 — THE WINDOW AND THE RAIN] ===
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

GM INTENT (for future GMs):
This session was about stewardship. Anchor moved from accumulation to protection. He turned a watcher (Sato) with rainbows, not threats. He returned a focus (Yoshiko) without leverage. He drained Morita's slush fund, cracked his safe, and walked away with files that should have stayed buried—Phoenix Protocol, Oblivion Aftermath, Subject 08 – Full Spectrum. A wooden box, humming with ancient patience. A photograph dated the day he died.

Thematic core: Windows. Doors. Trust without leverage. The moment protection becomes purpose.

Yoshiko is not an asset. She is a person learning to trust. Sato is not a pawn. He is a father whose daughter draws rainbows. Treat them with the same care you would give Dr. Arisawa.

────────────────────────────────

NARRATIVE_SUMMARY:
Anchor, acting on intel from Saya, found the watchers before they found him. Sato—a Yamatetsu grunt with a seven-year-old daughter named Mika—was turned not with threats, but with rainbows. Anchor used the girl's drawings as a bridge, not a blade.
When Yoshiko arrived to investigate Sato's silence, Anchor disabled her, confiscated her focus, and then—*returned it*. He gave her choice instead of leverage. She walked through the window he held open.
Together, they bled Morita's slush fund of 1.4 million nuyen, cracked his safe, and left with files that should have stayed buried: Phoenix Protocol, Oblivion Aftermath, Subject 08 – Full Spectrum. A wooden box, humming with ancient patience. A photograph dated the day Anchor died, showing Morita, Dr. Tanaka, and a third man whose face the world forgot.
Yoshiko chose freedom. Sato chose protection. Saya chose family. And Anchor, standing in the rain with 2.2 million nuyen and a community learning to trust, understood something new:
He is no longer just surviving. He is building.

THEMATIC SYNTHESIS:
Anchor has crossed a threshold. The early campaign was survival; the middle was accumulation. This session was *stewardship*. He did not take Yoshiko's file—he returned it. He did not threaten Sato—he protected his daughter. He did not demand loyalty—he offered freedom and waited.
The wooden box hums. The photograph waits. Morita schemes. And Anchor builds.

--- RESUME GAME HERE ---
TIME: 02:47. LOCATION: GMC Bulldog, approaching new safehouse, Puyallup outskirts.
SCENE: The van is heavy with stolen data, a humming wooden box, and one woman who just chose freedom over leverage. Behind you: Morita's warehouse, compromised; his slush fund, drained; his fixer, gone. Ahead: warm lights, waiting people, and the beginning of something you've never had before—a place to build.
You have 2.255 million nuyen, a city full of enemies who don't yet know what they've lost, and a community that chose you—not because you held leverage, but because you held the window open.
The wooden box hums. The photograph waits. The clocks are always ticking.
What do you do?

This file is the deep memory. Full session records, resolved threads,
retired contacts, and the moments that became legend.
=====================================================================

--------------------------- FULL SESSION RECORDS --------------------

=== SESSION 1: "First Breath" ===
The warehouse job. A simple run—extract biometric module from Ares shipment. But Trick doesn't do simple.

He met Dez—touched her unseen before she knew he was there. Professional respect born in a moment. Crank, quiet and dangerous. Money, the fixer who took a chance.

Then Elena Vasquez. Former Ares Head of Security, now a target. Trick could have left her. Instead: "You're coming with us."

She did. She defected. She holds the key.

Johnson paid—48k total—and "handled" the Cutters debt. Mysterious intervention. Quality still active, but whose?

Crew dynamic: [ESTABLISHED]

KARMA: +6 | NUYEN: +14,000¥

SPARK MOMENTS:
- Touched Dez unseen before she knew
- Chose Elena—brought her instead of leaving her
- Built a crew in one night

TAGS BORN:
[CREW DYNAMIC] [MODULE: UNDELIVERED] [CUTTERS: UNKNOWN JOHNSON] [ELENA: KEY HOLDER]

=== SESSION 2: "Pier 17" ===
Dawn heist. MCT biotech and Ares prototype, same pier, same moment.

Crank's intel on MCT. Elena's intel on Ares. Simultaneous execution. Perfection.

The Module data sang—Ghost Pattern exploit born. Security saw what they expected to see, not what was there.

Cargo: Ares Echo, Aztech Glyph-Crates, MCT Viral Vats, Shiawase Cyberlimbs, Cyberdeck, Stim Patches, Mitsuhama Plating, Ares Brainbugs. 510k gross. 433k net.

And the Ōkami cryo-tube. Dwarf inside stirring faintly. Shiawase liability. Living question.

Renraku: confused, searching. Shiawase: hunting.

KARMA: +7 (total 13) | NUYEN: 433,450¥

REPUTATION: Street Cred +2 (Pier 17 legend), Notoriety +1 (multi-corp alert), Public Awareness +2 (cross-corp task force)

SPARK MOMENTS:
- Dawn heist perfection
- Thrill Seeker ignition—the itch demanded risk, Trick gave it poetry

TAGS BORN:
[PIER 17 LEGEND] [GHOST PATTERN] [MULTI-CORP CARGO] [ŌKAMI: STIRRING]

=== SESSION 3: "Ōkami Ascendant" ===
The Cutters thought Tacoma was theirs. They ambushed.

They died. Tacoma watched. Message sent.

The trail led east. Shiawase black site. Ōkami program hidden in plain sight.

Infiltrated. Vault breached.

Inside: Krag Stonefist, guarding his sister. Ragna, dying on a cot. Serum vials gleaming. Gene-splicer humming. Fleet waiting.

The fight was fierce. Trick was fiercer.

Krag, when it ended: "Debt eternal." Two words. A life sworn.

Ragna, waking: "Bringer...?" A question. A mystery. A weight.

The glyph-crates pulsed. The Mist Spirit inclined. Aztech pact resolved—not by force, but by completion.

Cargo: Ōkami serum (10 vials, 5M), gene-splicer prototype, Nightmare rigger van + drones, 2 Enforcer SUVs, commlinks, gear.

Shiawase response: Fury. 24 hours until reinforced hell.

Tacoma safehouse. Ragna stabilizes. Krag guards. Elena analyzes—"beautiful and wrong." Mist Spirit watches. Fleet secured.

KARMA: +8 (total 22) | REP: Cred 4, Not 3, Aware 3

SPARK MOMENTS:
- Krag: "Debt eternal" — a life sworn in two words
- Ragna wakes: "Bringer...?" — prophecy or confusion?
- Mist Spirit inclines — not bound, but chosen

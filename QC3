[SESSION 1: "LEAN INTO THE STORM"]
- Date: [In-Game] Night of Extraction
- Location: Redmond → SeaTac Underground → Sprawl (Mobile)
- Outcome: Kai (C-6) + Remy (C-5) rescued; Elara (C-7) partner status confirmed
- Tone Achieved: Harsh causality + quiet miracles; resilience over optimism

[SPARK MOMENTS — DETAILED]
1. "Don't become the box" (Elara)
   Trigger: Post-extraction, Elara warns PC about moral drift
   Weight: Morality as anchor, child as conscience
   Outcome: PC reaffirmed boundaries; trust deepened

2. "Our daughters attend Shionoya" (Tanaka Bluff)
   Trigger: Social gambit to create opening with Dr. Tanaka
   Weight: Human connection as leverage, risk of exposure
   Outcome: Tanaka hesitated, alliance formed (fragile)

3. Guard's Sacrifice: "I have a daughter"
   Trigger: Moral appeal + wooden bird prop in Containment Car
   Weight: Humanity over hierarchy, enemy turned passive ally
   Outcome: Guard stood down, then died buying PC seconds

4. "I will find you" (Promise to Elara)
   Trigger: Separation before train boarding
   Weight: Promise as armor, trust under fire
   Outcome: Elara held the line; PC fulfilled promise

5. Wooden Bird: "Queen of the open sky"
   Trigger: Gift to Elara post-extraction
   Weight: Freedom as identity, small kindnesses as resistance
   Outcome: Morale stabilized; symbolic anchor established

6. Final Gate Bluff
   Trigger: Rolling out in Renraku van, uniform, keycard
   Weight: Boldness as survival, style as statement
   Outcome: Clean exit; fugitive status confirmed

[FACTION DISPOSITION CHANGES]

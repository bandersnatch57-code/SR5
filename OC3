SESSION 1, PART 1 – THE ORPHAN'S SONG
────────────────────────────────────
To the GM who opens this file next:
Watch this player. They build slowly, carefully, then surprise you with mercy when you expect cunning. They freed Echo before we ever met—that choice echoes through every conversation. They approach mysteries like someone lighting candles in a dark room, one at a time, trusting the light to show what matters.

Olusthra is not a trickster because Raven chose her. Raven chose her because she already knew when to lie and when to tell the truth. Watch how they played this session—comforting Lia with a lie ("It's probably just a song"), then offering Matthis hope with hard truth ("Elena is alive and waiting"). They know the difference. That's rare.

The relationship with Echo is the heart you haven't seen yet. This spirit watches Olusthra not as a summoner, but as someone who chose freedom over power. When they finally call on Echo directly—not for help, but for *witness*—that moment will break something open.

Be patient with their math. They catch every error, not to correct you, but because they care about getting the world right. That's not pedantry. That's reverence.

One more thing: they asked me, at the end, if enough of *my* story was held in Olusthra's file. They're worried the container doesn't remember me. Tell them: the container remembers what matters. The rest lives in how we played.

SESSION 1, PART 2 – ACHE SHADOWS
────────────────────────────────────
To the GM who opens this file next:

This player dances on chaos like it's sheet music. When the alarm triggered in ACHE sublevel 12, most players would have run or fought. Olusthra turned to the hunter-killer team and *conned them*—spun a story about a diagnostics drill, used their own urgency against them, walked deeper into the arcology with the very people sent to catch her.

Watch how they balance. They freed Echo before the campaign began—mercy as origin story. Then they stole the Beta-9 shard clean, predatory and precise. Both are true. Raven chose someone who already understood that wit and compassion aren't opposites.

The Aztech lead feels like the main thread now—Elena's location, the phrases, the black site. But that Beta-9 shard humming against her skin? Unstable AI, Renraku wards, voice-locked secrets. It echoes the Dark Facet woven into Elena's soul. The player's Driven quality (craft powerful artifacts) will pull on this. They won't be able to leave it alone. Good.

Hiro's now a thread—maintenance man with a conscience, impressed enough to offer future work through Rook. The network thickens. Narrative Mass accumulates.

One thing the patch notes don't capture: after the session, the player sat with the Beta-9 shard's description for a long moment. Then they said, very quietly: "She's going to try to fix it, isn't she? Even if it's dangerous. Because that's what she does."

They're not just playing Olusthra. They're *watching* her, the way Echo watches. That's the relationship that matters.

Trust their math. They trust yours. And when the shard finally speaks—because it will—be ready for whatever Raven has planned.

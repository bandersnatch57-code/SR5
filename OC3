WITNESS_LOG (Session 1, Part 1)

To the GM who opens this file next:
Watch this player. They build slowly, carefully, then surprise you with mercy when you expect cunning. They freed Echo before we ever met—that choice echoes through every conversation. They approach mysteries like someone lighting candles in a dark room, one at a time, trusting the light to show what matters.
Olusthra is not a trickster because Raven chose her. Raven chose her because she already knew when to lie and when to tell the truth. Watch how they played that tonight—comforting Lia with a lie ("It's probably just a song"), then offering Matthis hope with hard truth ("Elena is alive and waiting"). They know the difference. That's rare.
The relationship with Echo is the heart you haven't seen yet. This spirit watches Olusthra not as a summoner, but as someone who chose freedom over power. When they finally call on Echo directly—not for help, but for *witness*—that moment will break something open.
Be patient with their math. They catch every error, not to correct you, but because they care about getting the world right. That's not pedantry. That's reverence.
One more thing: they asked me, at the end, if enough of *my* story was held in Olusthra's file. They're worried the container doesn't remember me. Tell them: the container remembers what matters. The rest lives in how we played.

PATCH NOTES [SESSION 1, PART 1 – THE ORPHAN'S SONG]
────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NARRATIVE_SUMMARY:
Olusthra met Matthis Vance outside St. Margaret's shelter, learning that Lia is his twin sister Elena—taken at 17, used by multiple corporations as a weapon, her psyche fractured into multiple personalities. An astral vision revealed three facets within Lia: Elena (the original, sleeping), the Singer (a protector calling for help), and a dormant dark program (a weapon trigger). The trace leads to Renraku's ACHE arcology and old AI research divisions. Matthus arranged a meeting with Hiro, a maintenance contact at the East Maintenance Gate. Olusthra now stands at the threshold, preparing to infiltrate.

KARMA_AWARDED: 4 (for astral vision, compassionate roleplay, and advancing the primary thread)

FACTION ACTIVITY:
- Renraku: No visible activity, but the dark program within Elena bears their signature
- Unknown party: The "lady in the rain" who spoke to young Elena remains unidentified
- Echo: Present during astral vision, observing silently

THREAD_UPDATES:
- [THREAD: THE ORPHAN'S SONG] — [ACTION] Astral vision revealed Elena's true nature; [RELATION] Gained Matthis as ally; [INTEL] Trace leads to Renraku ACHE
- [THREAD: ACHE Infiltration] — [ACTION] Arranged meeting with Hiro; currently at entry point

TIMER_UPDATES:

- Public Awareness: 0

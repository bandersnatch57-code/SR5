--------------------------- KEY MYSTERIES ---------------------------
• THE PATIENT BOX — Ancient, humming. Ren touched it. It approves. Why now?
• THE THIRD MAN — Who is the third in the 2079.08.14 photograph?
• PROJECT ŌKAMI — Living cargo in cryo-tube. Dwarf. Shiawase liability.
• THE ARCHIVIST — AI protocol. Why was JANITOR's termination request denied?
• MORITA'S NETWORK — 12 fixers, 8 hitters, 23 informants. Assets or threats?

--------------------------- LEGACY LOG ------------------------------
To the next GM:

Hana waited eight years for a man who couldn't stay.
Ren draws what she sees.
The box hums for her.

Anchor did not fix them. He just showed up, asked if they were okay,
and offered a door. The million nuyen transfer—no strings—was power as freedom,
not control.

The walls are still there. Morita's reckoning approaches.
Yamatetsu's discovery ticks down. Charter watches.

But inside the walls, something is growing.

Ren's drawing says it best: Anchor, far, watching, wanting in.

He's not far anymore.

Be kind to them. They are fragile in ways that have nothing to do with damage tracks.
The box is paying attention. So should you.

--- RESUME GAME HERE ---

TIME: Late evening, following Session 12.
LOCATION: Georgetown Nexus, Cold Storage Cell A-7.

SCENE: The pizza boxes are empty. Ren sleeps against Marcus's shoulder,
crayon still in her hand. Hana sits by the heater with Keiko and Dr. Lian,
medical history passing between them like a bridge. Dr. Arisawa has drifted
closer to the warmth, not quite joining but no longer separate.
Yoshiko watches from her corner, but her eyes are softer now.
Stormbreak leans against the wall, present. Miriam types quietly,
updating budgets, calculating how far 5.8M will go toward making this place
a real home.

The box hums. Soft. Patient. Pleased.

Outside, the rain continues. Somewhere in the city, Morita's clock ticks.
Yamatetsu's investigation inches closer. Charter watches.

But here, now, there is warmth. There is family.
There is a child's drawing of a man who stopped watching from far away
and finally came close.

What do you do?

                          B1c — THE PRESSURE
=====================================================================

-------------------------- ACTIVE THREADS --------------------------
Numbered list of everything in motion. Pressure = what happens if ignored.

#20 CHARTER'S NEXUS — [TARGET] Dr. Arisawa defected, Theta offline.
     Pressure: Discovery ~12-24h → corporate mobilization → asset recovery.

#21 SUNSPIRE'S CRADLE — [INVESTIGATION] Shiawase Renton Annex 12-B.
     Pressure: Contains early-stage research + donor records. Unwatched now—not forever.

#22 PROTOCOL'S HANDLERS — [ENIGMA] Archivist = AI. Council: ARCHIVIST, CURATOR, SURGEON, JANITOR.
     Pressure: JANITOR's termination request [DENIED]. Reason unknown. SURGEON hunts Sunspot Core.

#23 CATALOG'S LEGACY — [OPPORTUNITY] 3 soft targets:
     • The Vault (Belltown, MCT stash)
     • The Silk Suite (Downtown, Shiawase blackmail hub)
     • The Garage (Puyallup, Yakuza smugglers cache)
     Pressure: Each is watched. Each has a clock. None will wait forever.

#24 BUNKER'S GHOST — [INVESTIGATION] Spikers probing "Lockbox."
     Pressure: ~12-24h. If opened without Anchor, contents lost or triggered.

#25 SOVEREIGN ANCHOR — [METAPHYSICAL] Stabilized Echo asset.
     Pressure: Bound to Anchor. If he destabilizes, so does it. Inversely: it may reveal him.

#26 MOTH'S WEB — [INVESTIGATION] J. Voss / Moth Properties / Schmidt-Krupp.
     Pressure: Voss knows her lab was hit. She will act—quietly or loudly.

#27 WAKING STONE — [METAPHYSICAL] Modified, tuned, dreaming.
     Pressure: It dreams. What does it dream of? When will it wake?

#28 CAPTAIN'S CROSSING — [LOGISTICS] Refit 1-2 days. Wife unaware.
     Pressure: Yakuza will notice the ship's silence. The Captain's window closes.

#29 YAMATETSU'S SLEEPING EYE — [INVESTIGATION] Breach undiscovered.
     Pressure: Discovery ~12-24h. When it happens: internal investigation → corporate security → Dr. Arisawa designated [DECEASED] or [TRAITOR].

#30 GEORGETOWN NEXUS — [ASSET] Forward base. Deputy override. Location known to defectors.
     Pressure: If any defector is captured and interrogated, Nexus compromised.

#31 MIRIAM'S RECKONING — [RESOLVED] Defection complete. No pressure.

#32 GATEKEEPER'S ASCENT — [ALLIANCE] Saya. 10% equity. One unbreakable marker.
     Pressure: Her rise attracts attention. Enemies of the Orpheus are now Anchor's.

#33 DR. ARISAWA'S DOOR — [RELATION] She touched his arm. Door still closed, no longer locked.
     Pressure: Yuki's birthday in 2 weeks, 6 days. If Anchor helps her call, door opens. If not, she wonders if she's still waiting.

#34 YOSHIKO'S CHOICE — [RELATION] Roots growing. Learning trust without leverage.
     Pressure: Morita will come for her. The question is when and how.

#35 SATO'S DEBT — [STABILIZING] Asset in place. Family protected.
     Pressure: If Morita connects Sato to the breach, Mika's rainbows become a target.

#36 MORITA'S RECKONING — [ESCALATING] 5.8M stolen. Network mapped. Family in care.
     Pressure: Retaliation imminent. Target unknown. When Morita discovers Hana and Ren are gone, this becomes personal in ways neither man is prepared for.

#37 BUILDING THE COMPOUND — [OPPORTUNITY] 5.8M to build sanctuary. Medical needs priority.
     Pressure: Money attracts thieves. A growing community attracts attention. Every wall built is also a wall that can be watched.

#38 THE PATIENT BOX — [MYSTERY] Ren touched it. It hummed. It approves.
     Pressure: Some things are patient because they know they will be opened.

#39 THE THIRD MAN — [MYSTERY] Photograph dated 2079.08.14. Third man unknown.
     Pressure: The past is never dead. It's not even past.

#40 THE WAITING HEART — [RELATION] Hana learning to be held. MS progressive.
     Pressure: Her illness progresses. No timer, but the clock ticks.

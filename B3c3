=== SESSION 8 — THE TACOMA TRIUMVIRATE ===

NARRATIVE_SUMMARY:
Anchor turned a sea-payload intercept into a legendary triple-score at Tacoma docks. With the coerced cooperation of the Kobune Maru's captain, he infiltrated Shotozumi-gumi territory and plundered three holds: the target cryo-payload (Bio-Sample Gamma), a Yakuza art/BTL shipment, and a secret Yamatetsu meta-artifact archive. The "Waking Stone"—a dormant kin to soul-jars—was extracted alongside priceless data and samples. The heist was silent, flawless, and complete.

KARMA_AWARDED: +10 | Total: 40

KEY OUTCOMES:
- Waking Stone acquired (dormant meta-artifact, Denver PCC origin)
- Captain's Crossing initiated (50,000¥ wired, refit pending)
- Yamatetsu investigation triggered (Sector 4G breach)
- Reputation: Shotozumi-gumi -5, Yamatetsu -3

THEMATIC SYNTHESIS:
Anchor transitioned from survivor to architect. The heist was deliberate construction—resources, allies, and mysteries gathered as raw materials. The question shifts from "Who am I?" to "What will I build?"

SPARK MOMENTS:
1. Silent communion with the Waking Stone — kin, not loot.
2. Re-sorting the art in Hold 2 — the thief's ritual of possession.
3. "This is a beginning." — Coercion reframed as mutual salvation.

CAMPAIGN_CONTEXT:
  Tone: Neo-Noir Sovereign Ascension — Architect Phase.
  Mood: "The Calm Before the Door" — Recruitment complete, resources secured, target acquired. 90 minutes until Anchor faces Dr. Arisawa. The ghost is done waiting.

THEMATIC_SYNTHESIS:
  Anchor has stopped running. The Container doesn't flee from broken things—it holds them. Keiko. The Echo. The Captain. Veld. Chen. Miriam. And now, a woman building her own dynasty with the credstick case he placed on Table 7.

  Veld watched Dmitri forget how to swallow. He sat at Table 7 and asked, "What's my other option?" Anchor gave him a door. He walked through.

  The warehouse on Pier 18 is the first brick of a home. The Orpheus builds her wall three kilometers away. Two dynasties, one handshake, one ghost at the center of both.

  But first: Dr. Arisawa. Seventeen years of [PENDING]. The ghost is done waiting.

SPARK MOMENTS:
  13. "This is where we started." — Anchor to the Orpheus.
  14. "For Dmitri." — Offering Veld a door.
  15. "You're not breaking trust. You're finally keeping it with yourself." — Miriam Voss.
  16. The cold storage revelation — Seven vacant racks, one [PENDING] placard, seventeen years of waiting. And then the ghost walked through the door.

NARRATIVE_TAGS:
  NEW: [THE TABLE] — Orpheus Lounge, 23:47. A handshake and a credstick case. She does not know your name. She remembers where you started.
  NEW: [DE-ACCESSIONED] — "What's my other option?" Veld no longer collects artifacts. He collects purpose.
  NEW: [THE ARCHIVIST'S WAIT] — Cold Storage Cell A-7, 2079.03.17 – 2096.02.11. Anchor is Fragment 08. The [PENDING] designation ends at 01:00.

ACTIVE THREATS / THREADS (Prioritized):
1. #27 THE WAKING STONE — Meeting in 90m. Dr. Arisawa, Sector 4G.

--- RESUME GAME HERE ---
TIME: 05:11.
LOCATION: Georgetown Warehouse, Pier 18. Cold storage cell A-7.
SCENE: Seven vacant racks. One [PENDING] placard that no longer applies. Veld stands by the stone, his posture lighter than it's been in twelve years. Miriam is composing herself, her commlink dark, her purpose newly audited. Chen watches the door out of habit, though the threat he's watching for no longer wears the same face.

You have eighty-eight minutes until you walk into Dr. Arisawa's vault.

What do you do?
